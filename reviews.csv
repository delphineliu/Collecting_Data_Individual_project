Pedersen,Reviewed in the Netherlands on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heart wrenching story,"Heart wrenching story about the involvement of the press (and institution) in Prince Harry’s life as a child and later as an adult. Worth the read. It will make you cry, it will make you angry and it will make you laugh."

J,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Completely Heartbreaking,"Just finished reading this and oh my god! I bought this book purely out of curiosity. I’ve seen the media stories, the spin, and I’ve never really paid that much attention and taken anything I’ve ever read in the media with a pinch of salt. I’m not a raging flag waving royalist but neither am I a republican I sort of sit somewhere in the middle. I read the Andrew Morton Diana’s story book years ago so I knew that the royal family back then were brutal and she was undoubtedly treated diabolically by them but part of me, a naive part of me assumed lessons had been learnt from everything that surrounded Diana. As I was reading this it became clear very quickly that I was wrong and that they, had learnt nothing.I’ve never read anything so heart-breaking in my entire life. There have been constant rumblings in the media saying what is written is lies, however I will say that Harry comes across as very believable and while I keep a reasonable amount of scepticism and cynicism I also know between the stories in the tabloids and this book which one I think is the more genuine.What I got from it was a twelve-year-old boy who was left traumatised by the death of his mother and who didn’t get the love and support from his family he should have, because that family was too emotionally stunted and entirely dysfunctional and too preoccupied with appearances and public opinion. That left him completely lost for a number of years. So much so he didn’t believe and couldn’t accept the fact his mother had died and he whole heartedly believed she was in hiding for a number of years and would one day return. That isn’t delusional, that is being trapped in a perfectly natural stage of grief. In this case denial because nobody helped him overcome it. Indeed, from what he has written he was packed off back to boarding school shortly after the funeral and just left to get on with it – at this point let’s not forget it was not your standard run of the mill funeral. It was a funeral where he was expected to walk behind his mother’s coffin with his brother with the eyes of the world on him (and yes, I agree with what Harry says Charles Spencer said about that – it was barbaric).Harry talks at length and with obvious fondness about his time in Africa and the army. (The chapter about his time in the army does go on a bit though). He says he found himself when he went to Africa and I agree but I believe he found his real purpose when he joined the army.  He admits he wasn’t a scholar and when he joined the army, he found something he was good at, excelled at - he found a purpose. Plus, there he was no longer the prince, he was just one of the lads, anonymous and free. But the spectre of the greedy monster that is the media took that away from him and returned him to the goldfish bowl to be hunted, dissected and bullied. That greedy monster also made him incredibly isolated because he had to always question people’s integrity and motives. Did people want to know him genuinely or were they just looking to make a few quid by prostituting their association with him to the press. Plus, he always had to consider whose lives he was destroying by becoming involved with them and was it really worth it? How incredibly lonely he was, was reiterated loud and clear through this book in different ways. He was desperately trying to find something to cling on to and all the while he was searching, he was being repeatedly retraumatised by the monster that is the British press, and they through their actions compounded that loneliness.The main running theme through this book is his (in my opinion justifiable) resentment and antipathy towards the media.  That is the whole point of this book after all, he is speaking out telling his story and not the story the media have written about him his entire life. This is Harry setting the record straight, for those people who choose to believe it. These were the people who he held responsible for his mother’s death (and it was a completely reasonable assumption on his part as we saw how Diana was hunted by paps).  In my opinion they really do have a lot to answer for and I find it incredibly telling that because Harry is standing up to them, and saying ‘they did this, this and this’ they obviously don’t like it, they don’t like being called out on their actions.  So, in response they are deliberately picking out the trivial parts from the book, the filler which when read in context with the other parts makes complete sense and explains how he was feeling was then compounded by trivial things like sibling rivalry. But they are pulling these parts and using them to ridicule him, making him come across as a whining baby who should just ‘get over it’ as they have said using the title of the book as their pun - to ‘spare’ us.  That is called gaslighting and it is what bullies do, and the press seem to be nothing but bullies.The press do not like being held accountable for their actions and it makes them even more vicious in their attempts to silence those who dare to defy them and they have waged open warfare on Harry because he and Meghan sued them and won over the fact they ‘acquired’ a private letter sent to Meghan’s father. A letter which she was advised to send to him by the queen, and I believe they have further lawsuits pending. So gaslighting and intimidation seem to be the order of the day to try and shut them up and make them go away.This has been the case for years though, the media believe they are untouchable and don’t like it when it is pointed out to them that they are really not. They come back with the ‘freedom of speech’ defence, ‘the free press’ and I quite agree with that because it is important to have freedom of speech but what they do is not freedom of speech it is quite the opposite in fact. They want to control the narrative, control what people think and say, sway public opinion and they do that by whipping up hysteria, invoking tribal instincts. Twisting the facts spinning things and printing half-truths, and sometimes downright bare faced lies, offering a drip feed of a certain opinion to manipulate the psyche, stir up feelings and emotions – and that is propaganda.  They think that is acceptable and you can see why they think that because we all know they do it to a certain extent but we still go along with it, society as a whole is complicit in their duplicity under the guise of ‘the free press’.  Then there is their argument that he is ‘fair game’ which is also a questionable one.  The main argument against that assumption is he never asked for that life, he was born into it he had no choice but to be thrust in front of the cameras from the moment he was born. What I got from what he wrote was that he knows and accepts the media will be interested in him because of who he is and what he was born into but what he doesn’t accept is the levels of harassment and intrusion that he has endured, or the bare faced lies told about him.What he has endured was truly horrific and nobody should have to live like that no matter who they are. I was barely half way through the book, when I had read the media had contacted the palace and lied about having a photograph of him to try and blackmail him into giving them a story – he called their bluff on that one which exposed their lie. They destroyed two personal relationships – one of the said girlfriends only lasted a couple of days before the harassment and intrusion made her rethink her choices. The other lasted longer and she once allegedly rang Harry in tears wondering why the paps always managed to find her and corner her wherever she was.  It was quickly discovered that they managed that because they had put a tracker on her car. They harassed and bullied family members of people he was associated with.  They illegally hacked his phone, they nearly ruined his army career; a journalist actually allegedly broke into Sandhurst while he was training and they spun it that they were doing it to expose the laxed security and showing Harry was in danger – Seriously?! They exposed where he was when he was in a warzone which was totally idiotically irresponsible as it was not only putting his life but all those around him at risk in that area.  He was pulled out twice and retrained twice before the MOD said enough was enough and gave him a nice safe desk job which I believe ultimately made him take the decision to leave the army, and that was all despite the media crowing about how responsible they were imposing a blackout to maintain security and his safety.  He talks repeatedly about two particular paps who come across to any reasonable human being as complete psychopaths, who cross the line repeatedly goading him just to try and get a rise out of him because they know that if they did get him to react, they would get more money for their photographs. Harry writes how he recalls his security once telling one that ‘they are going to get someone killed’ but they just didn’t care as long as they got their photograph. How can any of that behaviour be considered acceptable, justifiable or in the public interest?He holds up his hands and admits he made it easy for them at times with his own behaviour, (for example the nazi uniform debacle) but on those occasions it also comes across loud and clear that he had made genuine mistakes and had lapses of judgement. The media then jumped on those mistakes, blew them out of all proportion whipping up hysteria to the point where in some cases questions were asked in parliament.He repeatedly turned to his father for help, and was told repeatedly ‘just don’t read it’.  Maintaining a dignified silence is all very well but when your own employees appear to be complicit in peddling the lies fed to the media that is an entirely different story and then it smacks more of I’d rather not get involved in case they turn on me again.It is incredibly sad to read that he has been repeatedly let down by his own family but despite that, what also comes through loud and clear in his words is that he really doesn’t hold it against them, he is just saddened by it. He even makes excuses for his father’s behaviour and it is clear that he still loves them dearly despite everything. He tells of how he and William asked Charles not to marry Camilla.  They wanted him to be happy, they saw Camilla made him happy so they agreed to endorse the relationship for him so he could be happy. They just asked him don’t marry her and yet history tells us he ignored that very reasonable and understandable request. His relationship with William is particularly moving, it is clear he looked up to William growing up and just wanted… needed to be close to him but it is also clear William didn’t want that making Harry feel understandably alone. Aside from the usual sibling rivalry I think William should be more pitied than blamed as it is clear that he is also irrevocably damaged by his childhood and because he is still ‘institutionalised’ his issues manifest in displays of jealousy, competitiveness and resentment.But the most heart-breaking part of this story is the fact what has happened is inevitable because the monarchy is an institution, it is tradition and continuity and anything that challenges that is seen as a threat. It survives only because of public opinion, so that institution namely the people behind the scenes who seem to believe that they are the monarch rather than the monarch themselves and not the mere employees which they actually are, are complicit colluding with the media and manipulating circumstances making sure that the monster who controls what the public is supposed to think is kept happy and well fed so it doesn’t ultimately turn on them to the point where they are destroyed, thus also making them irelevent even if that means throwing members of that very family under the bus.  The royal family is also incredibly ruthless, it has been seen time and time again through the years. It cold heartedly cuts off and disposes of those it sees as a threat to its survival (and in some cases rightly so) and sadly I believe that Harry, through kicking against that system, through standing up and saying hang on a minute, and by telling his story is their latest amputation.I cannot say I enjoyed this book, because it is not meant to be enjoyed it was not written for entertainment but to enlighten. But reading it has confirmed for me a number things I have always suspected and disabused me of the hope that the royal family will ever learn from their mistakes."
Jill,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Darling Boy,"Potential spoiler alerts:  This book was a fascinating glimpse into Harry’s mind.  His young mother died.  Not only did she die, as all mothers do, she was killed in a car accident, as happens to some mothers.  Not only was she killed in a car accident, she was being chased by paparazzi, senselessly, which is unique.  This was beyond young Harry’s comprehension.  He was never ever able to process her death. Why, why, why? Her death plagued him, and her death still haunts him. His family was and still appears to be stoic.  They aren’t a touchy feely bunch.  They don’t talk about their emotions. It seems from the book they are too busy with their jobs to show their love of family through quality time.  And what gifts and acts of services from family would have been meaningful to the young prince?  So Harry floundered on his own without the support he needed and wanted at a critical time in his life.  Had he been younger or older, perhaps he would have handled his mom’s death differently. Despite the Queen’s and his father’s reported reliance on her Christian faith, Harry said his religion was nature. This hasn’t worked out so well for Harry.  Instead, he turned to alcohol and drugs.  Hard to say if he has an addiction from the book. It was an eye opener to me how much alcohol and drugs he uses in his circle! (Is this what all the elite do? No wonder the world is messed up!) I guess it’s very affordable and available?  He didn’t mention in the book what he does for fun.  Parties seemed to be a prime hobby for him. The alcohol and drugs are of course mood altering he admits, but were they also contributing to his depression and agoraphobia? He raises lots of good questions.  As far as the British paparazzi are concerned, as a not famous American, it’s hard for me to comprehend.  The difference between being a famous actor and a famous prince is that an actor chose the career knowing what comes with it.  Harry did not. I want to do a bit of research about British newspapers too.  It’s not clear to me whether Harry was obsessed with American equivalents of the New York Times or the National Enquirer.  Are all newspapers in Britain like the National Enquirer? And obsessed he was and is, based on his own words. I am on the internet a lot.  I have to use a search engine to find articles about Harry.  I am not bombarded with Harry articles.  I go to the American grocery store.  I see magazines.  I also see (trash type) newspapers.  I haven’t done research, I don’t have data, but don’t people by the trash type newspapers for fun?  “Elvis Presley seen walking at Graceland on his birthday”  Does anyone believe this stuff? So I’m trying to figure out what kind of newspapers these British papers are.  Some kind of cross between a legitimate newspaper and a trash newspaper?  Before reading this book, you may want to do some research first on newspapers in England.  For whatever reason, Harry put a lot of value-too much value- on the crap he read about himself.  It mattered a lot about what people he didn’t know thought about him.  The book also makes the people of England look very stupid (which I hope they aren’t) because Harry feels that the majority of people believe and are influenced by the junk that’s published about him. I guess to some extent, a bunch of people must buy the nonsense, and therefore support the publishers.  And his dad and the Queen were right about one thing: today, what is the monarchy without the “media”. If the monarchy did all of their services without the benefit of the publicity, would enough people from the commonwealth know about their good works and want to continue to support the monarchy? (If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, did it make a sound?) To persist, the monarchy needs publicity (bad publicity probably works as well as good publicity) like any other organization or business.  From Harry’s perspective, I drew the conclusion that his relatives seem to think it’s beneath them to do legitimate interviews with legitimate news media on a regular basis.  Perhaps they want to maintain an aloofness and mystique?  And they spend a lot of time crafting “leaks” to the media.  Why are “leaks” needed?  Why are “leaks” to the press ever needed? Perhaps they want deniability?  The normal sibling rivalry was reinforced and magnified hundredfold by Harry’s mom, dad, the queen, the monarchy… The two brothers would need a lot of joint counseling by someone to overcome the damage done but who has experience counseling heir/spare relationships?  The book makes it seem like the family was all business unless you were part of a couple.  The Queen and her husband, William and Kate, Charles and Camilla, within a small circle of two, the couples seem to relate to each other as family as well as business partners.  Outside each circle, the book read like it was all business.  And they all have egos to be fed.  Unlike other successful family businesses, this monarchy business appears to focus more on the individual, than on the company as a whole.  Unlike a sports team, it’s not about team monarchy, it’s about each super player on the team, including Harry.  Just the way the company is structured is odd.  The leadership of team monarchy wasn’t portrayed in the book as bringing the team together, growing each member of the team,  capitalizing on strengths and overcoming weaknesses… the normal stuff a good team leader does. For instance, if it’s one company, why are their multiple PR groups sending mixed messages to the press?  If I was queen haha there would be one PR group. If I found out about leaks, you would be “fired”.  And if it is the way Harry described, if I was queen, I wouldn’t tolerate competitive PR teams!  What a power trip those sides must be on! One person is the heir, others are spares, but until the heir becomes the next leader, why the preferential treatment within the company?  Oh wait!  Because the heir doesn’t have to earn the right to be king or queen, it’s given to him from the day he is born.  Yes, absolutely fascinating group dynamics going on here in this unique company!  A couple words about Meghan. She had a huge internet following on her own site, right? She was an influencer.  And yet Harry said she didn’t google him and didn’t know anything about him or his family, and it was so refreshing.  Harry also said after they hooked up, she was bombarded by the media negativity about Harry and herself, suicidal even. She didn’t pay attention before they hooked up but afterwards she paid so much attention she was suicidal?Anyway it was a very interesting read!"
Lara,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Prince of Hearts speaks – hear it first before you see the astonishing media crap,"A must read - and before you see all the entirely false media snippets in the press.The Prince of Hearts speaks - a raw, honest, and tender account, So heartbreaking, devastatingly shocking and sad at times, but with so much humour - it’s really hilarious and funny in places. It also is a beautiful love story and a story of hope. I was somewhat surprised by how self-reflective he has become, and really enjoyed the way describes his experiences. I was deeply touched in many places - laughed, cried, was angry, surprised, confused - all the emotions.I loved what he says about being in Africa and in the bush, to which I can relate to so much and have experienced this strange depth (‘the world before it developed into the world’). It shows him as a lot more sensitive, philosophical and also a lot more spiritual (in between the lines and in different chapters) than I thought, and it so beautiful to see the raw, sensitive and tender part of his person come through. He comes through so relatable and down to earth. So human this story with all its ups and downs.The book gives us a view behind the curtain of a life that some condemn for its fullness of riches. Yet it is so clearly a life ‘bred in captivity’, in a “gilded cage”, that shows money and riches are not equal to ‘real’ freedom (or love). There are squashing rules and painful consequences that come with their enjoyment. What if one is born into it unable to chose? Now he has chosen. What courage.It was a gripping, and highly engaging story. The audiobook version that Prince Harry narrates himself, is so well read that it felt like you were experiencing the moments in real time, I couldn’t stop putting it down. The meaning and feeling of his words comes across, the heart of the story, in a powerful way when hearing his own words.I highly recommend the book and to read it yourself or listen to the audio version first.Before you see the atrocious and slanderous total dismantling of mere snippets of the pieces shared in the book. It is astonishing what the press has done right now with this book and its words for all to see. So much misconstrued excerpts - don’t be put off and read it yourself first. Then compare, then make up your own mind. The press has shown itself in its most poisonous light I have ever witnessed in these last few days of the publication of the book.With that, what irony that the mission of the book of highlighting exactly that, was successful.The main mission this book is to make us more aware of what the media is doing and how it is doing it. Most of us may already know this. But here we are right now witnessing it live - right in front of our eyes. Will we notice? Will we ‘spare’ the time to read it for ourselves, to really see?The story of the book, highlights that this could be any of us, you, me, not just any royal or someone who happens to fall out of the press and media’s good graces or is scrutinised. (It reminds me of the book “Becoming” by Michelle Obama, where she describes a similar experience when becoming the First Lady.) For Prince Harry, it has been like this since birth.I really wanted to make sure to read it/hear it all first, before looking at the news, but noticed how hard it is at times. Things seeped through. Even friends and colleagues in my field (of psychology) made throw-away comments based on some terribly dangerous headlines (e.g. in relation to the Taliban, when he recounts his honest experiences in the Army). It was so clearly taken out of context, which you would notice if you had read it and gotten to that part 2 of the book already. A couple of words taken out of an entire account and then an emotive word slapped onto it to make title to change its entire meaning. We don’t have time – and are all so willing to take in just disjointed bits from the media every day.I could not believe the article published in the Guardian by journalist John Grace, only three days after the book’s publication, falsifying artistically the entire book for us. It doesn’t even mention that it is under the guise of satire, but claims at the beginning: “To busy to read it? All the love, rancour, drugs and petty fights are here.”What follows is a confusing write-up, looking like a compilation of excerpts taken straight from the book, but you don’t quite know which part is added by the journalist and is false – that is, unless you read it for yourself! Snippets taken from the book, something else slapped on to it at the end, that wasn’t even in the book. How on earth can the Guardian get away with this? Publishing something so incorrect and defamatory? But the damage has already been done for many I suspect, who as a result roll their eyes, and don’t want to read the book. But ironically, this is the whole point that the book is trying to share. And if you read these claims, you cannot ‘unread it’. It makes you think, it can poison you and anyone who reads it without noticing. Words have power.So here we are and have the most powerful evidence of what this book is actually about.The most ironic thing in itself is happening for us to see in bright daylight under our noses. The power of the media –  and so much falseness and untruths which we read about every single day. The mainstream press and media, most of us even ‘trust’.This book is not just about Prince Harry or setting his record straight, or share stories of his family, though this is the tool of the book. It seems to be about something so much bigger than that.What is of course fascinating as part of the story and in this whole unfolding drama is that we can all resonate personally so much with the family dynamics and the family story in so many ways (no matter what backgrounds we come from).All the family archetypes - all the roles we play in our families and the roles we feel trapped in or are assigned to hold, are represented in this book. May it range from the ‘golden child’, ‘black sheep’, ‘baby brother’, ‘big brother’, ‘rival brother’,’longed for sister’, ‘wicked stepmother’, ‘loving mother’, ‘absent father’, ‘the newcomer’, ‘the wicked daughter-in-law’, or so many other classics. These archetypes all represent our collective experience of family. We may recognise all these roles here in the book represented in some form or other. And this can really connect us to the family story in general, through our own lived experiences.But most of us will find it extremely hard to ever exit our assigned roles, or our family itself, however troubled and dysfunctional it is. It must be a hundred times harder for a member of a royal family who is controlled by and locked into ‘the Institution’ by blood.Harry has attempted the unthinkable and unspeakable, and in front of everyone to see. Good for him - and also how embarrassing… for ‘the Institution’.This may be the true core ‘danger’ of the book - for the media and press as well as the ‘Institution’ and the monarchy. It is clear with this book they were not successful at silencing him enough. The day before the launch, Prince Harry aptly comments in the ITV interview with Tom Bradby that “silence only allows the abuser to continue to abuse”. He also said “peace can only happen where there is truth”. This is an apt explanation of the purpose of this book, and it comes across in every chapter.It is bigger than just the story about Prince Harry because the book raises so many questions (and esp. with this vicious media and press reaction): How can we possibly discern right from wrong? And what role, what power does the media play out in this? One thing is for sure, you don’t want to be on the bad side of them.Prince Harry is standing up, speaking out and speaking his truth, which most of us are not courageous and brave enough to do at this level.If you check each, his words in the book account and the current media messages, it is like witnessing a modern crucifixion.We are watching it and it raises even deeper questions like: Would I speak out like this? How has the power completely shifted to controlled media? What means “freedom” and freedom of speech?The book raises in fact many questions on deeper issues about privacy, freedom of speech, human rights, but also unwittingly and indirectly - but to no surprise may question the entire existence of the monarchy. Of the validity and usefulness of an antiquated, backwards “Institution” behind the Monarchy itself - far too powerful for its own family members. Is it really still necessary to exist in this day and age? Many current members would of course not want to see it dismantled and as a result lose their existence. The war on Harry and any dissidents has to happen by default (as we are witness to) - to ensure its own survival. And since there is the existing long standing enmeshed relationship between the media and the Institution (“in bed with the Devil”- comment from the ITV interview, but not so direct in the book), both depend on each other for their survival. The book describes how – some of it in the subtext and in between the lines, but it also becomes clear in the story.If “it” (the Institution) wants to survive, it raises also the question if it could not show us a better example, be more of a role model? It doesn’t have to be this way – one or the other can only exist. Esp. in matters of the heart, family, unity, truthfulness, rather than the outdated stuffy rules, and power driven dynamics based on power and not losing face or pride? (But this will probably never happen.)In this book, the evoking of the deeper questions is done skilfully through the story of the heart, Prince Harry’s own story of his experiences and words. As such through metaphor it is a powerful tool to reach us deeper, to shake us up, especially with laughter and humour along the way that makes the reading (or listening) gripping, enjoyable and deeply engaging.With this book, Prince Harry shows tremendous bravery and courage and he could be applauded for daring this. And I can’t help but fear for him at the same time. This must be the toughest times of their lives right now, and I really wish them all the safety, love and protection they need around this time of transition “post-book”.I really hope that with this book he is able to achieve what he is hoping for.For one, to make an in-road for all of us to hold world-wide and British Press and media, its coverage and its employees more accountable for the suffering they cause to so many people every day.Because of this it is a must read / or listen to.It seems clear on more than the obvious level, that he is Diana’s son. How incredibly proud she must be - that he managed to ‘get out’. Though it is a hard road. If feels as though he is continuing the work that his mother had started. She still lives in so many peoples’ hearts across the globe and was able to touch so many – and even so many decades after. And with Prince Harry in his own right as Harry, what he is actually daring to do here is shining his own light, not being ashamed to have a voice and speaking and owning his truth - and with that leading by example.Not to be silenced. But good grief, we can see here in the book and the after effects, what a mammoth and difficult task it is and it comes with so much pain and consequences for him.My heart goes out to him and Meghan. And any other family member, I feel so much compassion for them. At the state of everything in our world right now. But there is also so much gratitude, love, joy and light in this book, peppered with tender mischievous humour which was so uplifting and able to create space for hope.Hope for change."
rosesinbud,Reviewed in Japan on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The story that everyone thinks they know, by the man who lived it and is living it still.","Prince Harry has always seemed to be one of those who is burdened with a lot of baggage; some of his own or fate's making; some created in the minds of others and published for money. This book offers his viewpoint of everything the world thinks it already knows. No big surprises, although his elder brother comes off as less brotherly than we would have hoped. We already knew that his father was a ""different sort of fellow"". Mostly the book is a simple rendering of Prince Harry's life to date, and as such, there are moments when you think he needed a spanking, together with other moments in the book where your heart is pained to know that he has carried his burden of grief over the loss of a mother and the failings of a father and elder brother to be a support to him when he needed it most. In other words, Harry was a second son of the current King of England, raised in the wealth and privileges of that class and, at the same time, he was an orphan of sorts, until he found his wife and started his own family. Which makes it all the more understandable why any threat to his wife or children- be it bullying or potential for violence - is regarded as totally unacceptable by Harry. The British stiff upper lip never helped him in his time of need, and certainly wasn't helpful to his wife in the face of lies and nasty racism in the press. Alternative action was required and he took it. Whether you like his wife or even him doesn't matter. He had to change something and he did. What long-term results will come of his decision to step back from royalty no one can say. He is living in a way that allows him to protect his family and quite possibly drop some of that old baggage by the side of the road. As I finished the book, I shed a few tears for him, and hoped that the ""spare"" would find his place in the world where he could be more than a body ""in case.."". I hope he will find himself as a whole person blessed with a loving family who are always there for him. He deserves that, at least."
Carl W. Hoffman,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beyond the headlines, a sad tale of deep loss","Whatever your reasons for buying this book - whether it be mere curiosity about palace gossip or partaking in the frenzy around the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time - you will get more out of it if you approach it with an open heart and mind. This well-written account of one of the most famous people in the world, ghostwritten by J.R. Moehringer, has a loose three-part structure: Harry’s early life (including the death of his mother), his 20s, and finally his life with Meghan. Moehringer is an expert storyteller, bringing to vivid life Harry’s thoughts, experiences and points of view. By the end of the book, you get a full understanding of not only why he chose to take a step back from royal life, but also why he chose to publish this for the world to read.Beyond the headlines and the tidbits about the book, it is an extremely sad tale. In some sense, Harry is lucky to have been born in modern times - royal families always suffered feuds and trysts, and in other times someone might have simply offed his head. Still, Harry has had a uniquely privileged - and uniquely terrible - life. Any child is much better off with a poor, loving set of parents than being wealthy and famous but losing your mother in the way Harry did. All of us of a certain age clearly remember Princess Diana’s death as one of the iconic moments of modern history, and seeing her children walk behind her coffin with millions of people viewing, couldn’t help but think, ‘Gosh, what could these children be thinking?’. Well, Harry tells us exactly what he thought at this moment, and thus brings private and public history together for the first time. He describes the incredible pain and isolation he felt, and how his lack of being able to remember her reduced his mother to nothing but a hole in his heart.It is easy to set up the book as a Harry & Meghan versus the Royal Family kind of tale, but the book is much more complicated than that. It raises serious questions about some of the most important issues we are grappling with, on a global scale: social media and its ill effects, the price of fame, and the tension between old traditions and modern times. For British audiences in particular, it raises - briefly - the question of what role the monarchy should continue to play in modern life, although Harry wisely says he cannot answer it himself. Harry was born to be a follower - he was never meant to rule, but at some point in his life he wanted to think for himself, and was not going to neatly fall in line with the institution that raised him, and take the abuses and slights - small and big - that he suffered. Instead, he chose to get up and leave for Los Angeles - the place where a man can remake himself anew and where there are so many other celebrities so it is easier to ‘blend in’. He is not the first royal to leave, but he is the first one to be able to tell us about the deal with the devil that Queen Elizabeth II made a long time ago with the press, and the personal costs it has exacted on his family, in a truthful and straightforward manner.I’m sure Queen Elizabeth did not intend for things to end this way. No grandmother wants to see her family split apart. But the way the palace - and by extension, his brother, father, and yes, Queen Elizabeth - treated Harry, is unforgivable. Harry and Meghan were dying by way of a thousand cuts via the work of palace courtiers, who maintained their job security by setting the royal family offices against each other via the press. But make no mistake, the royal family let them do that. It is not that Harry is against his father and brother. It is that he is so deeply disappointed with them, their lack of character, integrity, and true concern for the person who is supposed to be closest to them. So should we.When Harry decided to publish this memoir it was fairly clear to him that he was probably never going to mend the relationship with his family, and that those bridges were already burnt. So he went ahead and published a book, because nobody ever prepared him for a day job and now he has a mortgage to pay. But he also wrote the book because, I think, he really did need to tell his story, and it was important for him.Of course, there is another side to every story. But I tend to believe Harry more than I believe anyone else. With that said, haven’t we all had a lifetime’s worth of palace intrigue to indulge in? I hope Meghan and Harry, and all of us, can now move on."
Kailyn,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sad, Whimsical, Dark, Comedic, Introspective…words cannot describe you just have to read it","I don’t really read these kinds of books. I’m addicted to sci fi and historical romance and intake most my gossip/nonfiction news from social media mediums and independent research (Tik Tok and Twitter). I don’t think I’ve ever read a biography, autobiography, or memoir outside of an educational setting. I picked this up just bc I was interested in all the weird excerpts the media put all over headlines in the days leading up. I’m also a big supporter of evaluating primary sources first-hand as my liberal arts bachelors degree taught me before I form opinions. I expected a celebrity tell-all gossip piece..BUT, this piece took my breath away. I read it in one night and went through so many emotions. I had to put it down multiple times to laugh, cry, and self reflect. Well-done to Harry taking the hard step to be vulnerable to the world in his own way and taking control of his narrative and his writer is absolutely so talented. The writer is so magnificent, I cannot say it enough.This book is going to be analyzed in classrooms, positively, negatively, analytically one day as it touches on coming-of age, literature and motifs, the most recent war, and a love story and a social and political discourse on British press and its relationship with the Palace. People are going to be talking about this book for ages and as Meghan and Harry seem to be really polarizing to some. I recommend anyone supporter or not, British or American, read this book first and form your own opinions. Clear your mind of the bias from what you know of Harry from the press and media and read it about a story of a boy growing into a man. It’s really quite good when you look past you’re own biases.Harry’s really grown when it comes to his own biases and privilege and this book really explores that growth in a first person POV that also causes to reader to take a step back and evaluate themselves but I do think he needs to sit on his support of a Monarchy a bit more lol…it was nice as an American to understand British culture a bit more though and I feel like I was able to put myself in the other Royals shoes and humanize them as well! Since Meghan and Harry are the only ones who we’ve been able to authentically hear from as of late.I know a lot of people will speak on his chapters of his experiences in the war negatively, and to be honest. I wasn’t expecting that kind of candor and rawness and it resonated with me but in a introspectively beneficial way..as someone who is currently in the neo-stage of their military officer career (I only joined because I wanted to be a leader and get college paid but I’ve been more introspective on leadership and military more lately) I had to take military history classes when I was in college, I read many textbooks and memories who recount experiences similar to his from the civil war, Vietnam and WW1/2 perspective and we analyzed them relentlessly…but I haven’t seen a lot of memoirs from veterans from the War on Terror or from non-Americans. With the peacetime the U.S. is in I guess I doubt I’ll be serving long enough to ever experience the trauma he went through and it helps me understand the PTSD of modern soldiers and those veteran NCOs I work with. That section made me really introspective about the military and the way we’re trained and the discourse around the ethics of it even though his military experience is from a different country. (Side note this really helped me realize how important OPSEC is lol I literally screamed OPSEC at the book at one point).I enjoy the way he recounted his childhood and his relationship with his family. It was very tactful and well-written and I think every comment that a tabloid has pulled as “offensive” out of context was balanced out throughout the book as we really delved into the nuances of family and our childhoods. The people he mentions in this book are not just characters and celebrities in a show or tabloid but real people who are multifaceted and there is no antagonist and protagonist in real life.He also kept it spicy with the funny TMI moments about his social life and ~extracurricular~ activities. The random celebrity name drops were hilarious to me with his sarcastic tone and obviously not ill-mannered or narcissistic as I saw some implied. I think that was the perfect amount of comedy and tiny factoids that are ultimately harmless and affect no one except entertain the reader. I’m a very TMI person and the way he exposed embarrassing moments is the way I talk to my inner circle of friends and I felt like I was listening to a friend tell me a story on girls night. I saw on Twitter people were offended by the TMI but let’s be honest, if he hadn’t left in the spicy/funny comments people would have just said his memoir is boring and a waste of money and money-seeking. I’m sure there are plenty of other TMI details of his life that are private and he did not share. Everything he shared that people called “TMI” is inconsequential to the audience and only there to entertain comedic relief amongst the other dark themes in this book. This probably went through hella reviews and many consultations to make sure it wasn’t too out there.I could ramble forever about this book…I wanna join like a book club or reddit to discuss it. This is truly one of my favorite reads in like the last ten years. I may have separate opinions about the Harry v. the Monarchy discourse but I just want to endorse the book is SUCH a good read anyways for those on edge."

But boy did Harry make this public many country's are reading this...  but harry was not doing the right thing he smokes weed and drinks a lot even after being a family man maybe he does it to escape but I'm old fashion I agree with his brother and Kate and there father ""you were ready to die for your country in the military serving 10 years but not put up with normal harassment that comes with your job""  That's why they blame her not cause racism cause of her lack of holding on like they all do, cause when you love someone your willing to respect and honor him and that also means his family. My mother left when I was 10 after my father left to be a trucker they left me to live with strangers dad never came back until I said I would disappear if he didn't but I never did drugs or drink I married virgen at 16 and I'm still married to the same man 22 years later, I don't think people should blame others for there bad actions or do suptances either maybe that's what doesn't help you see life the right way.

Judy Lynn,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoyed this book immensely.,"Written from Harry’s POV this book is divided into a prologue, three sections, and an epilogue.  The prologue takes place after the funeral of Prince Phillip and sets the tone for why Harry has written this book. Each section takes a piece from the poem “Invictus” by William Ernest Henley.  Part One: “Out of the Night That Covers Me” covers Harry’s life from birth through the beginning of his active-duty military service.  Part Two: “Bloody, but Unbowed” covers his life from 2007-2016.  It offers detailed accounts of his life in the military and as a young man.  Part Three: “Captain of My Soul” details his life from meeting Meghan Markle through the birth of his daughter.  The epilogue brings the story to the present day. At 409 pages, this book covers a lot of content.Part one details the numbness, grief, and rage Harry felt at losing his mother at such a young age.  It also creates a picture of sibling rivalry between the two brothers.  It is normal for brothers to have rivalry, though theirs is amplified by the monarchy and expectations of the line of succession which lead to differing treatment given to the brothers.  Examples like: William having a larger bed and section of the room and William trying to exert his rank as Heir to order Harry to do something Willy wanted him to do.  Did this make me think poorly of William when Harry revealed these stories? Not exactly.  Family dynamics can be complicated.  When power and an expected level of formality are added, it is bound to lead to increased dysfunction.  I could feel Harry’s trauma over the loss of his mother.  I believe that the loss of his memories and his grief should have been addressed by his family when it happened.  I completely understood why he acted out in the effort to feel “something.”  Everyone experiences grief differently.  Everyone experiences trauma differently.  However, I do not think that Harry was such an anomaly that he couldn’t have received help. In fact, I would say the lack of help he received borders on child neglect.Part two, detailing his military service, gave me an appreciation for Harry as a veteran.  I was sad that his duties were cut short by press leaks that put Harry and his team in grave danger.  It was just another example of the selfishness of the press.  Why is the story so much more important than the safety of the troops or the mission in a war? This section also highlights that, as the Spare, Harry was allowed to have active duty while William was not.  Decisions like these ultimately drove bigger wedges and animosity between the brothers.Part three is a love story.  It is obvious that Harry loves his wife and his children.  I adored reading about his feelings for Meghan and hers for him.  I loved getting an inside look at how they worked on their relationship from the beginning.  I really enjoyed reading about the things they had in common that drew them together despite their differences. Reading his recollection of his children’s births brought tears to my eyes. I needed tissues.  That doesn’t happen often for me.  I really appreciated the open communication in their relationship.  I love that Meghan was strong enough to encourage Harry to get help when he needed it.  I love Harry’s openness discussing how he sought help through therapy, meditation, and other means.  It takes a level of vulnerability and awareness to detail a mental health journey the way he has.  I also appreciated their frank discussion of Meghan’s depression and suicidal ideations.  That the amount of stress and pressure and lack of support was so great that she reached that point really speaks volumes about the way things were.  I also appreciated the clear discussion on their grief after her miscarriage.  I am thankful they have spoken so openly about a topic often covered up.Family dynamics and power distribution are a big part of Harry’s book.  They have affected his life in nearly every area: from the ability to speak to relatives at will, to finances, to protection and security.  They also factored into how the press treated him. How Harry, Meghan and their children have been treated by the British press is abominable.  He has stated in the book, and in interviews, that the silence of his family in addressing the horrible attacks on them by the press has been the ultimate betrayal.  I must agree with him on this point.Overall, this book made me feel sad.  I am sad that Harry did not have the loving family relationships he longed for.  I am sad that his mother’s death was so traumatic.  I am sad that he did not receive help for his grief earlier than he did.  I am sad that the crown, the monarchy, and formalities take precedence over love, honor, and family.  I am sad to see two brothers, who have shared so many of the same things in life, torn apart by differences based on status and power.I enjoyed this book immensely.  In fact, I had a very hard time putting it down.  I liked the detailed stories, the pace, and the structure of the book.  There are a lot of personal details which some will find objectionable.  Personally, I admired the frankness.  It is important to remember that even a royal is a person with feelings and emotions that are 100% valid.  Those details expose him as human: mistakes and missteps as well as the successes and the things done right.I have thoughts on some of the other reviews that have been written and on my personal feelings regarding this book.  In fact, I have so many thoughts that I have created an entire blog post on the subject."
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex Fan Account,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Emotional human story with unprecedented insight,"The searing image of Prince Harry and his brother Prince William walking behind their mother’s coffin is etched in all of our minds. And what I notice throughout is the most seismic event of Harry’s life, when he tragically lost his mother at the age of 12, which shapes the book. There are some interesting (sometimes funny) anecdotes about his royal life when he was younger, but threaded across the pages are also incredibly raw and emotional moments. What is also conveyed very deeply is the pitiful life of “the Spare” - often feeling as though your life has no value, no ultimate mission/goal, you have nothing to offer because you will never wear the Crown. As Prince Harry himself says, when his whole life has been told through the lens of the media, why should he not be able to (finally) tell his own story from the man who lived it! It is undeniably depressing that Harry and Meghan felt they couldn’t continue in their royal roles. They could have been a huge force for good, supporting communities in the UK and the Commonwealth, representing a true Modern Monarchy with their enviable platform and privilege. Leaked excerpts of The Duke’s memoirs don’t do his story justice. The book as a whole is a must read! Highly recommend :)"
Stepho,Reviewed in Australia on 20 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total relief that the Spare is not the Heir,"Strap yourselves in people!First of all, Harry takes no responsibility for anything in this book, nor does he have a basic concept of human behaviour. E.g. he finds Meghan’s ‘lack of research’ on him cute, whereas Britain and the Royals found it disrespectful. He doesn’t explore how he was probably the orchestrator of this. Perhaps there was cultural difference but also a lot of it is down to him not preparing her and therefore he is complicit in setting her up to fail. He has zero insight into the gender bias of papers - and how his lack of care and preparation of Meghan in this area probably contributed to the treatment of her.He also contradicts Meghan and says the Palace approved all of Meghan’s outfits…. Hmmm.He does the same for protocols - Diana said there was a person training her on protocols, it’s common knowledge- why didn’t he get Meghan such a person? Even the average British person of the street would have been better than no-one. Again, here he set her up to fail.If his recounting of certain incidents is correct, it shows that Harry said very little to his family about the media hounding. His rambling internal, paranoid monologue is very different from what he says to Will and Charles. No wonder they were baffled - he hardly said two words to them. He doesn’t tell them of death threats, or Meghan’s crying and wanting to die, none of it. Yet he blames them for not helping. It’s clear the palace staff have their own agenda, but on several occasions he speaks to and meets up with his family in which he has the chance to say something, and what he says is that the papers are horrible. No specifics on how it is impacting them mentally. The only thing that is directed to the Queen is stuff about Meghan’s Dad, and the Queen immediately tries to help. So this idea that they dismissed him is clearly untrue - he never really tells them about it (by his own admission).Mental HealthClearly he has serious mental health issues. Paranoia, PTSD, and, he is extremely immature and anxious. Anxiety makes those who suffer from it hyperfocus on themselves, their feelings and their thoughts, and they have very little insight into how their actions impact others. They also can’t see other people’s perspective as they are trapped in their own mind. Harry demonstrates this throughout the book and it makes him come across like a spoilt brat.He talks about how he mocked his disabled teacher, but there is no adult reflection on this - like how you always see in biographies. Usually, you would see comments that show growth and humanity such as: “looking back, I feel shame for how I treated her”, - however, these are not included! He doesn’t really see his teacher as a person, the insight he gets from his mocking of her is that he likes making his friends laugh. There are multiple incidents throughout the book like this. I’m not sure if he doesn’t have the maturity to reflect and take account for his actions, or if he’s still too stuck in his paranoia, or if he’s a narcissist, or just a spoilt Eton brat. Whatever the reason, it is clear he has no self-awareness or understanding of the world outside of his very rigid black & white take on it.He complains about Charles’ style of fatherhood, but to me it sounded lovely. I think it was a normal thing in the 80s and 90s for Dads not to be very huggy - especially the higher up you go on the class ladder. It sounds like Charles loves him very much, and showed affection in the only way he knew how - writing. I imagine Charles will be so very upset at all this.He seems to have only been happy in the Army, and I think he should have stayed in it. Admittedly the Invictus Games was a great achievement of his, but clearly he doesn’t care much about that anymore.MediaThis is what the book and all his interviews should have focused on. He is right about Murdoch, the Daily Mail, The Sun, and Rebecca Brooks (it’s so cringy how he creates an anagram of her name). What is sad, is that he only fleetingly launches into how the public sees these stories that he hates so much. 1.2 million Brits read the Daily Mail. In a county of 67 million, this is very small number. Also, truth in media in Britain is among the lowest in the world. The Daily Mail and the Sun are distrusted the most. The entire city of Liverpool has self-banned the Sun. Just because something is printed does not mean people believe it, as evidenced by the millions of people who went to Harry & Meghan’s wedding, the billions who watched it on TV, and the millions of well wishers across the world who turned out for their tours. There is no mention of the public in the entire book other than him saying people were mean on social media. Social media is a cesspool - it’s not the real world, most were probably bots. I agree with Charles when he advised him not to read them. However, the general adoring public - the people who paid his and Meghan’s salary - he has very little care or mention. He mentions them with disdain after Diana died - says their crying and sadness annoyed him because they didn’t know her. This really angered me because he’s part of the royal family and knows full well people see them as an extension of their own due to all the charity engagements and public speaking. Diana was always mixing with the public - people DID know her - of course not like he did, but they did interact with her. I thought his dismissal of that was cold. I also thought his lack of insight into how the public felt to see their favourite royals ditch them and their charities because of a paper that only a small portion read, and an even smaller portion believe, was astounding. This was what infuriated me most in this book. He was angry about the palace taking his security away after Oprah, and appears to have no idea why - or why people are angry with him after that interview - including his own friends. At this stage I couldn’t tell if he was gaslighting the reader or if he’s just really stupid. It became clear that he never cared about the people of his county to begin with. All he cared about was some clearly invented competitive war between his family (which he at some point contradicts because he says the Queen gives the working royals their charities and engagements). The jealously he claims Wills has doesn’t make sense, reading between the lines I think Wills frustration with Harry is his obsessions, magical thinking and self-obsessed thinking, not jealousy. Will clearly knew that Harry was going to struggle having a wife in the media eye (he tells him this, but Harry is offended by this - jumping to some bizarre conclusion that it must mean Wills hates Meghan - when it’s clear he’s trying to prepare him). Again, he can’t see anything but his own warped take on reality. There was no balancing of opinion, no insight into anything other than his obsession with how he thought history was repeating itself. Something he has never got over (which is fair) but it guides him into having a negative and fantastical view of absolutely everything. He needs a better psychologist.Overall I thought the people around him should have brought up these obvious problems before publishing (perhaps they did and he didn’t care because he thinks he’s right). I think this book is sad, and that he has burned all his bridges. Someone needs to explain to him that the palace can’t control the media - to do so would be fascist - the government can change laws on truth in media, and he should have gone down this route. Kicking up a hissy fit about how the palace should have done something shows how little he knows (they did deny A LOT), but also how little he understands social dynamics and the constitutional monarchy (which is truly bizarre). If the palace starts meddling in the media by refuting stories and making dictating what can be said, they would open up a can of worms that would be far worse for all of them.And lastly, the way he rights in short 3 word sentences with lots of italics reminds me of sales people on LinkedIn. Someone a while back called this style of writing Broetry. It shows his lack of education but also his immaturity. There are also loads of Americanisms in there. He says he called his security man Graham Crackers - these didn’t exist in England (still don’t) - they are an American product. He wouldn’t have known what they were, so this is nonsense. He also uses “ass” rather than the British “arse” in the same section. That bit certainly wasn’t written by him or it was made up to purposefully con the American audience. I was so bored in the middle but persisted on, and the whole thing left me feeling incredibly relieved that he is not the Heir and is indeed a very distant Spare."
Pennywise The Diva,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well Done, Harry!","I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought both the hard copy and the Audible version; the book because I want to have it in my library and the Audible version because hearing is somewhat of an issue for me.So many different people (mostly royal watchers) swore the book was going to be about how Harry trashed the Institution, his family, and the people of the UK. It wasn't like that. Sure, he revealed details about what he said to his family because of the frustration with them not helping and even feeding stories to the toxic media and threw them under the bus, but it wasn't in anger or hate. Desperation at needing to protect his family, yes, but it wasn't malicious. Not all family is close nit so I'm glad he was able to speak his truth without limits or hesitation in his own words and in his own voice as the way he saw it.The book was the journey of a young man who had been traumatized by the sudden death of his mother at age 12, then not having any true understanding of the truth of her death, so it sent him on a journey of depression, doubt, anger, and fear at the loss of a mother whom he loved so dearly, only to be further traumatized by a hateful media and subjects with no one to bother helping him. They didn't even provide security for them. Depression is very complex in that it envelops you without you even knowing that it's happening or understanding it. The worst thing about depression is others don't recognize it or go into denial about it. I can only imagine with a royal family that they don't want the public to think of their family member as mentally ill, so he didn't get the help that he needed until he realized he needed it. Only then was he able to face his demons and move forward. This helped him find love and I'm all here for that.I'm so glad I got the Audible version because the cadence in his voice was soothing, even when he was revealing the most painful parts of his life up until now. Parts of the book made me laugh out loud, others made me angry at him; (i.e., me hearing about the poker game - ""STRIP POKER? ARE YOU NUTS??"") Being the ""spare"" allowed him to find so much more with the world than what he had been relegated to. I believe this is the issue with the brothers; one who is the future King, thus limited in the freedom and expressions of an ordinary person vs a second child who no one was really checking for, and for him to take the extraordinary journey that lead him to finding the true happiness of his life is nothing short of remarkable. He pulled no punches about himself; the drugs, the drinking, the unintentional racism, his lack of education. Coming to terms with his mother's death was a catharsis and allowed him to move forward and find the love of his life.I'm conflicted by King Charles. The first and second parts of the book, he seemed like an attentive and caring father to him, but then he put country above the safety of his younger son and family. That's hard to read. It seems like the royals are more driven by what their subjects think and allowed a frenzied toxic press to hound them so bad that they fled his birth country. All he had to do was say ""that's enough,"" or show more support than he did other than his address to the nature when the queen died and he mentioned them. He and the Queen truly seemed to like Meghan but again, country first to the detriment of the family. I seriously hope this won't happen to Princes George and Louis. This could have been a huge step in pushing the UK forward on race relations. Instead, it set them back decades. It's a shame. Being a constitutional monarchy may have something to do with it, but still - that's your son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren. I had hoped the Queen would have said or done more since he was her favorite. Leaving him behind so he missed his Gran before she died was cruel.I wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex all of the love, peace and happiness they deserve. I would 1M recommend this book.  Outstanding! Congratulations, Prince Harry!"
Lamb,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed thoughts about Spare,"I decided to buy and read the actual book rather than trust the excerpts that keep being published here and there. I’m glad I did as I’ve got better context now.I’m not able to determine how accurate Prince Harry’s take on things is but it’s interesting reading his version and how he perceives various things. Note: I’m assuming Harry had final say on the wording throughout the book and so the responsibility is on him. I believe elements of the press, not all, are way over the top and cruelly intrusive, judgemental, immoral, etc. etc. and H & M have perhaps suffered from their bad side more than most, but not as uniquely as they allege/think. It’s interesting to read of the media dynamic and then remember the reliance of the press to report on things the Royal Family do. Much of what RF members do, including Harry then and now, is engage the attention of the media of one kind or another to raise awareness of things they support. The book isn’t always very discerning in its attacks and there are, in my view, a fair few hypocritical statements and stances. I also think there are aspects of the book which were definitely surplus to requirements and Harry has given no thought to the invasion of privacy of family members,  ex’s , first sexual partner etc. who have since had to face the fallout in the media. He can’t say he didn’t expect that to happen surely! He’s the one who tells us what the paps are like for trying to get a photo or story.Telling us of his sexual exploits, drug taking, peeing himself etc. isn’t classy writing and added little if anything to his story. He’s also very keen on generalising his derogatory comments with his “ the Brits” this and “ the Palace” that. In blaming the press and the general public who dare to read anything written in it, he seems to insult those he later wants to thank for buying the book! Strange approach. He also takes multiple swipes at his family.  Perhaps he can hide behind official silence as tacit acknowledgment his version is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If it is, much is disappointing about the Firm behind the scenes though. In the end I still doubt whether we have the full story rather than selective parts of it. Many of Harry’s comments seem like random digs and for me that undermines the more interesting and valid points he’s trying to put across in this book. There are better sections, including accounts of some very positive times and deeds. It’s a mixed bag.I could go on commenting (what he writes about his mother, how he refers to Paul Burrell, his beliefs, his army service, the Queen etc.) but you’re best reading all for yourself. If you’re like me you’ll come away thinking “Wow, is that how it really is/was” for some parts and in others you’ll be cringing and saying “ Ok  but what about X” or “ Why would you write that bit?!”.Good luck to Harry and his family. I wish them well for the future….but I won’t be looking forward to any sequels to this book unless they have a whole different vibe."
Sophie Shopper,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sad, Funny, Tragic, Surreal, Visceral, Insightful, Intelligent and Loving","First off, I will say that I have always been a big supporter of Harry, first, & then Meghan. So, I go into reading this book with loving interest and a positive outlook. I trusted that he would actually tell us the truth (as he experienced it) with no sugar coating. And I thank him for successfully doing just that.I did not know anything about his military service and found that highly intriguing to read about. I cannot imagine being a pilot of a helicopter much less an Apache helicopter in wartime. Very impressive. Think about what it takes to do that - not something every man or woman can learn to do.I didn't know about his adventures in Africa and other countries. Those stories were really fun to read. I'm so glad this book was not just about his family and the 'Royal' part of his life. Yes, he did put things in the book about that, of course. But it was way more than just royal stuff, which really (to me) told us the story of who Harry truly is.Naturally he discussed his mother. I'm an old lady & can remember all that Diana went through as she was going through it in front of the world. I was shocked about her death, as we all were. The thing I did not know about was that Harry did not believe his mother to be dead. He thought she was in hiding. It broke my heart to pieces to learn about this fact. And now that I have read what his thinking was at the time - I fully understand why he would believe that, and to this day nobody really got any evidence or proof of her demise to show to Harry or William. It still seems really odd. The whole thing.It's very important when you lose somebody close to you that you are able to view the body. I guess that is not a royal or British custom. However, in reading books on Thanatology after my husband died, all grief therapists usually agree that seeing the deceased person is very important.  Otherwise, you find yourself constantly searching the faces in a crowd or wondering if maybe they somehow, they slipped away and are living somewhere else. I know, because that's how I felt when I didn't know that viewing his body was actually healthier than not. It helps you face reality. Then you can heal.I knew that Harry would no doubt mention the Paparazzi and the Tabloids. Little did I know how really horrible it has been. The way he explained it made me feel claustrophobic and so downtrodden. And I was just reading it - not experiencing it.  I got very angry about how the British people not only allowed this; but fed off of it. How his own father and brother felt like it was just something you have to accept, rather than standing up (like a man) and saying 'NO, this will not be tolerated'.And with that, I learned that Queens and Kings, who I thought are heads of state and run the country - are not. They are nothing more than props. They have no power. And if they have any - they don't seem to use it in the right way. Why is that?And this so called 'Institution' or gang of courtiers/assistants etc. - who are they? It seems like they are all running everything there in the palace or Balmoral or wherever. Not the Queen or King. Not the Prime Minister or Parliament. Just common, everyday people working for the royal family appear to be the bosses. The Queen had to 'obey' them. Now King Charles has to as well.  What? That's crazy. What is the point of having a Monarchy if it's just all pretend, and the royalty has no power?I am keeping my fingers crossed that when enough people read this book that they will stop looking at Meghan in a negative light. My Gosh. Harry loves her and his children.  She loves him. Let this couple live in peace. Stop saying nasty things about them and out and out lies. Who does that benefit? Let the tabloids go back to their headlines about alien abductions and 3 headed babies, etc.If the Brits don't want Harry & Meghan then I hope they live here in the US for the rest of their lives. They don't need a country who has stomped all over them & squished them down in the mud. Shame on you if you're one of those who has been a party to that.This book is a real eye opener. I think after all he and his Mom went through with being betrayed by people that are supposed to love them - but don't - that he deserves to tell this story in his own way. To not only clear somethings up - but to share with us very interesting parts of his life. I hope after a few more decades he'll write an updated memoir too. Because I'm sure he is going to do great things with his life. He is not perfect. But neither is anybody else. As human beings we need to remember that."
Forêt Interdite,Reviewed in France on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,To read urgently!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of writing of these memoirs of Prince Harry. The emotion is there from the start. How not to be touched by the drama experienced by this little boy and his brother: the tragic loss of his mother, Princess Diana, in circumstances that are at the very heart of the book (toxic notoriety, the role of the press, the lack of support in the family which is seen as a Firm)?The dedication is, unsurprisingly: ""For Meg, and Archie, and Lili... and, of course, my mother.""A sentence of William Faulkner accompanies our reading at the beginning of the book: ""The past is never dead. It's not even past.""The book is divided into three parts, the titles of which are taken from the poem ""Invictus"" by Ernest Henley: Out of the night that covers me; Bloody, but Unbowed; Captain of my soul. These three parts contain very short chapters (sometimes a single page) which evoke precise or felt or fleeting memories, sometimes painful, sometimes tender and funny. What emerges is the total honesty of the character, his humanity, his desire to understand his mistakes, to grow up to become a responsible human being, protector of his country, his wife, his family of which his mother would have been proud. . It's masterful.I recommend reading this book which can also be read as a dystopian fairy tale where we see behind the scenes of classic fairy tales. The prince here is poor, unloved. As in fairy tales, he undergoes a tragic ordeal (here, the loss of his mother, killed by dragons, understand the press). He then carried out a life-saving initiatory journey which led him down the wrong paths but, in the end, which transformed him into a knight serving his kingdom, then his Belle Meghan, whom he succeeded in snatching her from the claws of the dragons (the sexist and racist tabloid press) who are still rampant in the kingdom from which he moves away to protect his soul mate and their children. They lived happily with their children, in Montecito, fighting for a better world far, far away from the monarchy held by media dragons.To read urgently!"
Gloria Lesher,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What's it Like, to be a Prince?","Many will read Prince Harry’s memoir to find out for themselves what it’s like to belong to the British royal family. I was caught by the first few paragraphs—it was an entry into a dazzling, yet somber world. My first thought: This memoir is a gem of good writing! So I bought the memoir’s Kindle version and settled into a chair with sheer happiness as I began my favorite activity: reading. Prince Harry (and his ghostwriter) easily transported me into a 12-year-old child’s mind as I ate an imagined meal with Harry and his brother “Willy” in the “Dinner Dungeon.” I found myself agreeing as Harry tells himself, “What hell, being an adult.” He captures the elusive feel of memory, when you’re not quite sure whether you are remembering events yourself, or only stories told over and over to you about your childhood.The British press are out of line, mocking a 13-year-old Harry on the front page a little more than a year after Diana’s death. Harry is in for some hard knocks. He (or his ghostwriter) displays subtle erudition by quoting the 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (life can be “nasty, brutish and short”), holding up that image to mirror teenage Harry’s life. Harry also displays self-insight when he writes that Africa, teeming with life, represented what he yearned for. Despite the outward glamor of his existence, Harry feels deadened inside, not only by his mother’s death, but by the rules, restrictions and emotional coldness of the adults around him. As I read the book, I understood why the young prince detested the press. He was a normal, rowdy 17-year-old male, smoking weed with his mates. The next thing he knows, he’s on the front pages again—this time being described as a habitual drug user, off to rehab no less. A bit later, he’s unfairly accused by the press of cheating on a test. Yet he’s unable to correct these twisted stories, impotent to rectify or defend himself. How frustrating!This unfair situation continues into Harry’s adult life. While the press has a heyday shaming him and blowing things out of proportion, Harry admits his faults. He tries to redeem himself through long talks with his father Charles and a rabbi, about the Nazi costume he donned for a party. The reader watches Harry gradually mature into a brave and honorable military man who flies an Apache helicopter. As with any war, the sequences about Afghanistan horrified and repulsed me. While I agree that often Harry probably gives readers TMI, his hilarious comments about his frostbitten male appendage made me laugh. I grew to appreciate his descriptions of his squadron’s and his own mental wounds and existential questions.Like any one of us, Harry is an imperfect human being. Realizing during a therapy session that he is addicted to the press—obsessed with reading the tabloids and raging about their dishonesty—doesn’t change him or his behavior. The sad, perhaps inevitable family squabbles follow, as Harry meets Meghan, falls in love, and marries her despite the reservations of his brother and other royals. I understood and sympathized why Harry and Meghan decided to sue when the tabloids printed Meghan’s personal letter to her father, without permission. I admired Harry’s drive to protect his wife and children. He stands up for them, fights for them, even when he has to rail against the royal institution that brought him into this world.My favorite parts of the memoir are when Harry delves into the spiritual. His mysterious conversation with a medium and his and Meghan’s visit to Diana’s grave touched me. In my favorite scene, Harry experiences a mystical oneness with the world. He comes upon a herd of elephants while in a boat on the Okavango River near Kingfisher Island during a storm. A sudden understanding of his life’s purpose to “shine a light” still doesn’t prevent him from continuing to struggle with working out who he is. This memoir has depth. It not only made me laugh, but also made me shed a few tears, and reconsider my opinions. I’m glad Harry set the record straight. It’s a common reason why people write a memoir. Nevertheless, in my mind, I can still hear the late Queen’s astute observation that “Recollections may vary.”"
Shari Ring Wolf,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyable read,"I’m not much for paying attention to tabloids or watching the news, I don’t follow celebrities. But I did watch Harry and Meghan on Netflix, and found them both to be very likable.  I was especially taken with how down to earth and genuinely nice Prince Harry seems to be.  I found both Harry and Meghan to be pleasant and likable, and that is why I read this book.  I have to say that I’m tired of all the articles on the Internet about their popularity or lack of it, about the “royal family feud”, and general gossip.I have never watched or followed the Royal Family, though I do remember Princess Di and her work with AIDS awareness.  I was floored by some of the things I read in this book about what it’s like growing up Royal.  I do not envy either William or Harry or anyone else born into a royal family.  I found those parts explaining royal life interesting and informative, though not my reason for reading the book, and certainly not information I was seeking.  I wanted to read about Prince Harry’s life, his philosophies, courtship of Meghan, and his life as a husband, father, and person.  The book did not disappoint in those areas.  I also found the family dynamics interesting in the setting.  It is so much like any family, yet different given the rules and customs the characters had to live up to and within.  The book is very well written.  I finished it in 2 days, getting little else done once I started reading.I skipped about 100 pages to get to the part where he and Meghan meet.  The tone of the book began to change soon after that part.  It became darker, angrier.  It’s understandable, given the subject matter, but it became a bit repetitive…I mean the subject matter became repetitive, constant harassment by press in a variety of forms.  Abuse by the press is a theme throughout the entire book, but when the abuse became heaped on Meghan, Harry writes with intense anger—much more intense than in the rest of the book.  Again, I find it understandable. In fact, I think more husbands should stand behind their wives that way.What I liked most was the style of Harry’s story, showing that while his environment and upbringing are very different from people I know, as human beings we are very much the same.  Prince Harry is as down to earth in this book as he appears to be on film…or streaming.  I enjoyed the book, I even went back and read those skipped pages.  I’ve decided I won’t ruin the experience by reading news articles and gossip columns about the book.  It tells a wonderful story, and I’m willing to leave it at that."
MSTJ,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly Revealing,"I recommend you read the memoir.After reading the book I came away greatly moved from the raw revelations of Prince Harry’s life experiences. A heartfelt in-depth view of Harry growing up, living with and ultimately surviving trauma from the death of his mother. After his mother died he had to navigate life with trauma from that loss (at 12 years old) and lack of human affection from the elders in his family.Members of the Royal Family are controlled by aides, courtiers and tabloids. Face to face communication with family members is infrequent regardless of how close their homes are. Appointments have to be made through staff (aides, etc) in order for family members to have most face to face communication. Additionally when they are having family gatherings there are hierarchical structures and deference that needs to be adhered to when socializing and conversing so one has to be care of what they say and how they say it so as not to offend someone with a higher title.Hugs and show of close affection within his family is extremely rare. Relationships with girlfriends are ruined by the tabloid intrusion, robbing him of lasting human affection that could provide a sense of belonging for him. Meeting Meghan at a time when he was eager to settle down and start a family of his own prevailed because they were both committed to their love for each other and hence endured the numerous challenges that came their way. Also she was mature and had established her own financial independence prior to the relationship.It seemed like there was an effort by the aides, courtiers and tabloids to undermine Harry and Meghan’s relationship at every turn while Harry and Meghan did not get the family support and understanding I would have expected family to provide for a son, brother, grandmother, which demonstrated the dysfunctional Royal Family structure. The structure is like a corporation with backstabbing individuals who lie and jostle for relevance while the tabloid media controls the narrative inside and outside the institution based on individual (Principals) household need for good publicity.To improve, I think they need to have a press structure similar to the White House where the press secretary has briefings and answers questions from the press pool about the work the Royal Family does and how the tax payer dollars are being spent. The anonymous royal sources speaking to the tabloids lacks transparency and fosters gossip, lies and innuendos.I think there needs to be trust to achieve genuine reconciliation. The family needs to have discussions without the staff in the room so that there are no leaks to the tabloids."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fascinating and well told. The story of a life, and a man trying to save himself and his family","This book is so much more than the media soundbites make it out to be. It's the well-told story of a life, and of a man trying to save his own life and the lives of those he loves. Sure he was born into privilege, but in the case of being born into the royal family, that privilege is more like a prison than it is like freedom. You have to read the book to understand why writing it is the only way he could make enough of an impact to bring about the change this deeply dysfunctional family needs. They - his father, Camilla, and the ""institution"" mainly, sold Harry down the river from the time he was a teenager, by trading unflattering and even untrue (like that he was a drug addict) stories about the ""disposable son"" in order to buy protection for more valuable family members - Charles, Camilla, Will. They were always going to keep playing this dirty game, and you can see it happening right now - all the headlines of ""do-gooding"" by the royals and soundbite headlines meant to damage Harry and Meghan that are popping up now in my newsfeed. So, when you've tried everything and they don't get it and they don't get it and they don't get it and they won't STOP, then you say, well I'm going to stand up and say my truth right out loud and own it and face up to it, not hide behind anonymity, not play the dirty little game. Shining the light on it is the only way to take away the power of their strategy. So now they know their secret is out, and perhaps, maybe, it gets them to change their behavior. Harry's life has been sad, but he isn't whiney or self-pitying. The reviews that say that...well, I have to think they haven't actually read the book. He loves his father and brother, and has been treated like second class by both. In fact, it's clear that Harry has gone out of his way to try to understand the position his father and brother are in - the constraints, the pressures they live under. And equally clear that Charles and Will have spent Not One Second trying to do the same with Harry, because, well, he is after all just the Spare. He's not even hard on Camilla - in fact he is surprisingly empathetic about her situation and the constraints that prevented her and Charles from being together. His only gripe with her is that she uses the media to bolster her image with a willingness to take his down. It's a fascinating look at the reality behind the facade of royalty, often heartbreaking, sometimes funny and surprising. I mean, I never pictured Prince Philip cooking up on the grill! The book reads like a conversation - someone telling you his story. It's a story worth hearing for lots of reasons beyond the royal aspect, because it's a story of how dysfunction sets in as the result of the stiff upper lip approach, when feelings are not acknowledged and left unresolved, when conversations and getting real are not allowed. It's a story about sorrow and anguish, and love and loyalty - and how misused that term is in the royal family. Harry gets real, and it's real interesting, and it will be real interesting to see if and how this changes their behavior. When Harry says he doesn't know how it will help to stay quiet...well reading the book will help you understand what he means. He's taking away their power to hurt him and particularly his wife and family, by exposing just how they go about doing it. This book is GOOD."
Amanda,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully Written,"I'm a 35 year old American and all I knew of the Royal family before Meghan married Harry was that my parents were sad when Diana died and that the grocery store checkout magazines always had headlines about them. I was kind of drawn in and charmed by the idea of them accepting Meghan and how pretty and warm she always looked (I remember sending a picture of her in a pale pink dress with a matching jacket when she was pregnant with her son to my group chat with a note about how oh my God she is the most gorgeous human ever) and it made me sad and angry when like...all of the media over there seemed to hate her all of a sudden. But even though I felt bad for her I never had strong feelings about Harry, he was just kinda there. Now? I freaking love Harry. Harry and Meghan fan for life. LIFE.I am shell-shocked at how freaking real and good this book is. I saw so many headlines leading up to the release that made the book sound like a (super fun tbh) mean and petty silly little airing of grievances. And instead it's this incredibly thoughtful, fair, raw depiction of both his family and his life. It kind of blows my mind the royals were so short sighted they willingly gave up what appears to be the only one among them with an ounce of emotional intelligence. He and Meghan are both so sincerely self-deprecating and open and honest and they contrast so dramatically against his family. The rest of them seem so stilted and fake and political and sneaky in comparison.How honest he is about his insecurities and ambitions and hopes and dreams and embarrassments is kind of stunning. Openly acknowledging what is complicated about England's history. Confessing freely to his own limitations in so many ways like Eminem in the battle scene in 8 Mile is ridiculous but kind of effective?! Like....he isn't pretending not to be upset about being thought stupid, about being a spare, about being single, about so many things. He's human and it hurt and I respect him for not doing the pretending to be unbothered thing.Also, he is insanely fair to his family. Far more than they seem to deserve!. He is so freaking kind to them. Going out of his way to defend Kate and Will from tabloid gossip and repeatedly explain why things that were said about them or done to them were unfair and untrue. He acknowledges being emotionally unavailable, even to his brother who would want to discuss their mother at times.  He even defends his dad's reasoning on so many things and makes him seem bumbling and ineffectual rather than like the indifferently cruel and disinterested father he seemed like he must be before.Reading this book is the closest I have ever come to having any sympathy at all for the rest of the Royal family. They just seemed like cold selfish remote awful little rich people before but Harry's book makes them seem more human and likable and normal. Like people who if they hadn't been born to this might have actually stood a chance of being halfway decent but they were born into this and now they've just leaned into being unbearable cartoon villains for forever.The description of the bee, the fly, and the wasp? How he used to grocery shop? Such good writing. And him being painfully honest about him having mom issues and looking for mother figures and wanting to make people laugh and looking for signs in things. I know they're being mean about it in some headlines and I don't believe in signs or astrology or psychics or whatever myself but I know a lot of people who do. I think it's kind of normal and human after a big and unexpected loss. My friend lost her 12 year old son to an asthma attack that stopped his heart and she is constantly on the hunt for ""signs"". Connections, coincidences, messages.He's even fair about his mom. You can tell he knows he kind of puts her on a pedestal but he acknowledges she was imperfect, especially when he talks about her insecurity over them loving their nanny. I think the main takeaway from the book for me is how sad I feel for him. Because he seems to love everyone in his family for who they are. He sees them clearly, their flaws and weaknesses and strengths, and loves them. And you can just tell it wasn't ever reciprocated. Because none of them seem capable of loving him back.""How lost we are, I thought. How far we’ve strayed. How much damage has been done to our love, our bond, and why? All because a dreadful mob of dweebs and crones and cut-rate criminals and clinically diagnosable sadists along Fleet Street feel the need to get their jollies and plump their profits—and work out their personal issues—by tormenting one very large, very ancient, very dysfunctional family.""Anyway, it is a really good book. I really enjoyed it, read it super fast, and highly recommend."
Wren,Reviewed in Spain on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read,"More of a love letter to his father and mother. Full of palace intrigue and manipulating leeches of courtiers whose relationships with the press smells of kickbacks even though Harry never stated this. (Hoping the Crown uses these descriptions of the Wasp and the Bee in future episodes!) This book is filled with hate towards the paparazzi and the media who not only gave him trauma from his earliest memories, killed his mother and put his own life in danger countless times but who also manipulated the masses into believing outright lies by saying 'palace sources'.  This book is a defiant slap back at the media giants, tabloids and so called journalists who use the royal family as a money making machine and a clear description of the fear of the media and the use of it by shady royals who try to improve their image or take attention away from themselves by throwing others under the bus. An exciting read from beginning to end. Contains a description of how royal engagements work and how money is used. Harry obviously doesn't realize that he describes those hanger ons who are just there to take advantage of the perks. The only boring part for me was the description of his years in the military. This is definitely a history book from someone who for years had no voice and finally answered my question about Diana. Read it! Don't be unwittingly manipulated by the narrative that this is just Harry airing dirty laundry. To the contrary, my opinion of his father went up and I feel real pity for his brother. Reading this will open your eyes to how we are unknowningly manipulated by the press and how the culture of hate is a money making business."
Bryony Holyoake,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex……writing….","….his own personal story of his life and experiences.I am a third of the way through it.The writing style is easy to follow, and the chapters chronologically written.From the outset it is evident that Princess Diana’s death has a profound effect, which, to me, is totally understandable.At age 12/13, any child adjusting to the sudden loss of a beloved mother in a traumatic way is devastating.As young teenagers growing up, any young person would ask questions, want to know the why’s and wherefore’s.It is well documented by newspapers, TV, and often the general public witnessing themselves, the undeniably intrusive focus on Princess Diana and her life.Whatever anybody’s views and observations are, it cannot be denied the focus was (and still is) intrusive.Not one person on this earth, as human beings, can choose who we are born to,  the circumstances of our birth are never of our own making.We begin by not knowing anything else but the people and circumstances surrounding us.Growing up, work, life experience, the world, creates questions.Whoever and wherever human beings find themselves.Poverty, health, wealth, the culture and country where we are born, education, governments, corruption, all have their effects on human beings individually.People…..human beings….every individual person.“Walk a mile in my shoes”.Empathy.Laws, traditions, expectations, freedom.Extortion, fraud, scams, welfare.For me, Prince Harry is in the process of experiencing life, his life, and is endeavouring to assimilate his own experiences, and learning about the person he is.And in relation to his childhood and family circumstance, the fact of being born to a Royal family, the Royal Family of Great Britain.His writing is thoughtful, is considering, and still not sure, asking questions of himself, as well as others.It is obvious he is capable of learning and responds to disciplined training, with a deep respect for his senior military officers, and the men responsible for his welfare as “bodyguards”.He admits to not fully understanding what is necessary. To me, that is not unusual at all.Any person from any walk of life will experience massive adjustments and retraining when joining the military.Attending new schools, any kind of learning.Prince Harry’s schooling descriptions definitely opened my eyes.Especially when considering that successive UK government officials attended the same, or similar schools.That in itself made me think laterally, and the obvious life experiences of those government officials could colour their “ruling”, laws and (UK) country wide policy decisions, and personal attitudes.In other words, the possibility of being actually incapable of empathizing with the Great Britain population, the life experiences of UK citizens, all UK citizens, whether born in the UK, immigrants, including asylum seekers.Prince Harry does not mention this aspect himself at all, at least in what I have read so far.My own lateral thinking, not his.My motive in wishing to read Prince Harry’s book, is to “listen”, words from “the horse’s mouth”, not gossip.I personally refuse to watch, read, listen to hyped headlines about any well known people, anyway.Often, headlines are there right in front of you when watching TV news, or seeing headlines on newspapers’ front pages.I personally do not buy any magazine, newspaper, for sensationalist headlines or articles.Every human being has the innate right to respect and privacy.If laws are broken, and there is open danger and risk to others, then legal protective measures are in place.It does seem logical to me that Princess Diana, as a human being, had the human right to be protected from any unwanted personal intrusion.In my opinion, Princess Diana still does.She had surviving family,  relatives, and her own two sons, and now grandchildren.Her grandchildren completely innocent, nothing to report.There are not two sets of “standards” for anybody.Any human being can (and does) make mistakes.It is the learning from them and thus changing attitudes and subsequent actions that make a world, (literally),  of difference.Deliberate conscious ‘educated’ choices made that potentially harm others are not mistakes.Personally I would not have entitled Prince Harry’s book “Spare”.For me, that introduces a “negative” immediate impression.Prince Harry puts the term “spare” into a context in his writing, I believe it is not necessary in the “headline title”,  on the front cover.I recommend reading Prince Harry’s book.Read it objectively, and gain insight.Lateral thinking, empathy is a positive outcome from reading this book.I truly hope Prince Harry’s own family and friends read it for themselves.They can challenge, feed back to Prince Harry themselves personally and, most importantly, privately.Truly privately.It is potentially a beautiful “win win” outcome.Any public statement is not necessary.NBI finished reading Prince Harry’s book this morning.Definitely food for thought, constructive thought and personal reflection.I found reading his book very moving.It saddens me that important caring family relationships are jeopardized by any outsiders interfering in any way.I have no experience of the unique pressures of following Royal protocols that seem to stifle loving spontaneity.I do know about “cycles of deprivation”, subject matter for all to study, which helps in beginning to understand the many aspects.“walk a mile in my shoes”.I am a “white UK Citizen”, I have friends and family who are “black UK Citizens”.I know the life long traumas and discomfort they experience themselves routinely.All my family and friends are human beings, individual people, not black or white.Prince Harry, his wife, Meghan, his children Archie and Lilli, and all of their extended families are in my prayers.May God keep them all safe, and bless them all with compassionate understanding in their true endeavours."
Terry C.,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What Would Diana say? ""A Capable Wife Who Can Find Her Values are Far More than Corals"" Prov. 31:10","I read in SPARE, that during the wedding, the Song of Solomon was read. That was written by King Solomon. King Solomon in his last chapter of Proverbs, the book of wisdom, he wrote the words of wisdom spoken from a mother to her son,  who was also a king. That mother in Chapter 31:5-31, gave the king wisdom on what to look for, when searching for the most valuable capable wife.The world watched Harry grow and grieve lost of that dear mother. The world watched his life being saved by his wife from the shackles of what imprisoned his mother and sent her to an early grave. Of course the predators who held him hostage will hate the woman who saved him. Don't all us mothers who protect our men and our babies experience that same hate?  The same names?Yet, that personification of a real wife, busted up a history of toxicity with love. History will forever talk about ...  the ""breaking up of that cycle,"" that Harry's loving wife suffered so much abuse behind.Now the world beholds and is blessed by the blossoming of the real deal ... A REAL MAN. And written as at the end of the book: Ain't nothing SPARE that.  The universe can't get enough of REAL MEN!As to having to plan an escape route? Some families are so blessed not to have from the same womb: a child of light and a child of darkness. Excellence and the good for nothing man. Child of war and child of peace. Both fighting to conquer the same space. Yet, in reality ""the majority wins."" Right along with in this world: intrigue and dirty games and the rewards for playing them.When such have won the hearts of family, the one of peace have to acknowledge ""everyone has the right to choice"" ""Before anger ... take your leave."" Then go off and create your own dynasty.  With a foundation of what is important to you: Love, kindness, truth and excellence.  That is what Harry and Meghan did and for that brave choice.... Princess Diana, his dear Mummy would be proud of beyond words. As would any loving mother.Yes: Love Conquers All. Any honest-hearted person would know, Princess Diana would love Harry's queen: Meghan.  Anyone who claims otherwise, is just looking at themselves in the mirror."
Jersey Girl Book Reviews / Jersey Girl Sizzling Book Reviews,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Spare is the story of Prince Harry's telling his truth of life in Britain's Royal family that spans from Princess Diana's death on August 30, 1997 to Queen Elizabeth II's death on September 8, 2022.The memoir is broken into three parts: life after Princess Diana's death, his military career, and his romantic relationship / marriage to Meghan Markle.I read the memoir with an open mind, but I did take his account with a grain of salt, because every family has dysfunction, and like the old adage states that there is always three sides to every story: his, theirs (the Royal family), and the truth (which no one but Harry, the Royal family, and Royal insiders really know). That being said, I was still curious enough to read what Prince Harry had to say in his memoir, and I came away with the feeling that his life journey has been an emotional roller coaster ride that encompasses the full gamut of emotions.Spare starts out with the princes finding out from Prince Charles that Princess Diana has been killed in an automobile accident in Paris on August 30, 1997. Prince Harry was tweleve years of age when his mother died, and the reader can't help but understand how her death completely changed his life. Throughout the book, Harry's grief over the death of his mother is palpable, he did not believe she died until 2007 when he visited Paris and drove through the tunnel that he got a painful reality and closure.The second part of the book focuses on life after Princess Diana and his life in the Royal family. Prince Harry acknowledges that he did not enjoy living in the regimented life within the Royal fish bowl, and not having a normal life. He was not a good student, prone to panic attacks and low self-esteem, and had to deal with the Heir vs. Spare sibling rivalry and competitveness with Prince William. He also yearned for a close father-son relationship with Prince Charles, but his father was reserved and not one to express affection.The main theme throughout the memoir is devoted to Prince Harry's dislike and contempt for the paparazzi and their headlines and stories that often put him in a terrible light with the public (his naughty Harry partying days), and how the paparazzi was always ruthlessly stalking the Royal family, from his school days to his military career to his marriage to Meghan. He can't understand the Royal family's motto of never complain, never explain, and their complicity toward the media. It is this complicity and the fear for his family's safety that eventually leads Prince Harry and Meghan to leave the Royal family for the US. But underneath the surface is also his strained relationship with Prince Charles and Prince William that led him to write this memoir. I think that Prince Harry's recollections and shade towards his family will only lead to a permanent rift, there really was no need to air the family's personal business to the public.Writing Spare may have been cathartic for Prince Harry to release his personal demons, but I don't think it will fare well in the long run, what a shame. What he could have done is just put the Royal life behind him, and live the normal life that he and Meghan wanted without the public snark and money schemes that this memoir, the Netflix documentary, and subsequent media publicity has created, especially since he spouted his comtempt for the paparazzi and publicity throughout the book. I enjoyed his memory of Princess Diana, but the rest of his story is just a sad account of a man that had a hard time finding himself within his family."
Dr G,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Be strong Harry , you got this!!!","I have so much admiration for this prince, until 3 years ago I didn’t know much about royals, but when I started reading stories about them when the Sussexes stepped down, I felt so much love for these two .Nobody should be forced to live in a toxic environment, especially when it’s affecting your mental health, I am blaming these boys father for this situation they are in, let me get this straight: you cheat on my mother while you are married to her, then after her death you marry the same woman you cheated my mother with , this is craziness, he seems to be ok with it now but it’s still madness for me and this is where the problems started, they didn’t start with Meghan, Meghan came to amplify what was a crack already, and the brother, your job is to protect your brother and protect each other’s, I understand the duty part but no duty whatsoever should come between you and your family and this case the only brother you have, the only thing that connects you to the love of your mother truly, he should have protected that no matter what he feels towards Meghan ( Meghan difficult and rude , please are you going to tell me that in that RF this is the only rude person you got in there? I am sure she is not rude but incase she is , let’s say she is horrible, is she the only horrible person you got in there? Or she is just the first mixed race and she is married to a spare so who cares about her well being? Harry you did the right thing, the media is going to demonize you and belittle you because you are talking about the issues they don’t want to hear about, racism, slavery…these are two things the Brit’s and actually Americans don’t like to hear especially from someone with your background, but today you have that blood flowing in your veins( your two beautiful babies) so it’s personal to you as well….hang in there, stay courageous, keep doing the good work and what you must….please do not let them get away with everything they have done easily even if the public is going to throw stones at you , some of us are praying for you. And I really did pray for you."
Karen,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,More than expected in a good way,"I do not normally read memoirs or biographies because I am generally not that interested in the lives of people who have no direct impact on my life. But this is different for me because I actually like this person and want to know what and how they feel about their life as opposed to what has been written by those who do not know them and will write anything said to them by their enemies. This is very well written and evokes many feelings from joy to horror at how he and his have been treated.I purchased the audio, kindle, and hardback versions of this because I wanted one for display, and the others to read. I have to recommend that you listen to this book as I did and followed along with my kindle. It is one thing to read the words but a completely different one to hear the author of those words actually speak them. You get the feeling behind the words and the thoughts that formed them. Also, we find out that the author is very good at invoking other voices, particularly an American accent.The story starts on a rather low note after the death of his grandfather and a meeting with his family. He then moves into the start of his tale as he remembers it and relates how he was first informed of the death of his mother and moves through time giving us a look at his life through his eyes and how he felt and was treated by those both in his family and on the outside of it who felt that he was their pawn to be moved and abused. He moves through the whole of his life including the most recent events, which is where we conclude.This was much more than I expected since I thought it would be a much softer look at things. I am glad that this answered questions and actually confirmed a lot that had been observed by many in the world. The formatting is also nicely done though most times I do not like a lot of short chapters they worked in this instance to break things up in a way that allowed you to reflect on things as they were presented. I enjoyed it and encourage others to give it a read, and highly recommend the audio."
E. Burns,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,People hate abusers but they hate truth tellers more.,"The book was excellent in how it dealt with trauma, healing and the maliciousness of the British Press.  Also, I got the audible version and WOW!  Harry should narrate more books in the future.  He has a wonderful speaking voiceWhat was revealed is the book has blackmail proofed Harry by leaving nothing for the tabloids to hold over him plus it ripped down the curtains to destroy the illusion that the BRF was a family. It's a child abusing, cruel, emotionally and mentally destructive business.  Because of this, I truly believe that the RF is incapable of normal human love.  Yet how dare Meghan and Harry stand up for themselves and remove toxic people from their lives.Also revealed:That Harry and William were never ever that close.  Not for Harry’s lack of desire to have a close bond with his brother and lack of trying, but more because William always appeared to see Harry as a lesser being.  Someone to be ignored, mocked, trashed or used at will.The brainwashing runs deep in the Royal belief system. Charles and William truly believe they are not only super special, but better than all and they can both do as they will and harm others at will.The most fragile thing on Charles is his ego. This isn’t about making amends but making sure he’s the center of attention.  From fretting over Catherines name starting with a C and needing to be changed to making sure that he gets no negative press so Harry gets labeled a drug user.  It’s all about ME should be embroidered in the RF coat of arms.That there isn’t equality in the family.  There are those who get more, bigger, better, brighter simply because of birth order, or who they’re sleeping with (looking at you Camilla) or if they know where all the bodies are buried (looking at you Andrew).  Goodness, fairness, equality?  Love, kindness, service?  HA!One brother can live in opulent wealth, the other in a hovel.  But we knew that from previous interviews with Fergie etc.Camilla is a snake.  She leaks to the press. A lot.  All to rehab her image and throw Charles sons under the bus.  In a five-bedroom mansion, she converted Harry’s bedroom to ‘her dressing room’ when she already had one.  I mean,  seriously, the woman is soulless.Kate has zero friends or social circle. No one to tease her about baby brain, no one to tell her that her coat dresses suck, no one to pull her down off her high horse. She's alone, running to Bully when she feels slighted.  It’s both very weird and very sad.The BRF handles resources like lost toddlers and have abysmal money management skills.  A father with two sons tells the second one he can’t afford him or a wife.  After 35 years of knowing said son existed and would need support like his older brother.  WTF!?!?All in all, properties are poorly kept, upkeep and modernization is unheard of.  Truly, the inmates run the asylum or in this case, the hired help does as they want, treat people like dirt, shun work and will burn you to the ground if you get in their way.  No wonder the tabloids are full of gossip and the windowsills on BP haven’t been painted since the Queen mother was alive.Lastly, the way Meghan was treated both breaks my heart and enrages me at the same time. There are people in the RF, her family, British Press and social media who have earned their own extra roasty toasty, super nasty rings of hell for contributing to her pain.  Seriously, if you want to see evil on the hoof-- They're in the BRF and Media.This alone makes it a brutal read, because you see just how little empathy, ethics or kindness exists in both the family and the media they service."
Bing,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has affected me deeply.,"I bought both the hard copy and audio and am so glad I did audio as well. Hearing Harry’s own voice explaining his own story with the expression of authenticity and depth. I learnt more about his pain and the misinformed public fed by the interpretation and twist of the British media. To endure such pettiness and hypocrisy from the very family he needed , to suffering the painful effects of his mothers death. I loved how intelligent and perceptive he is after being painted as dumb and childish. Going forward I don’t ever want to hear anyone saying he should have not been so explicit about life behind those palace walls. This is part of the healing process. I am so happy he found his wife and took care of his mental health, which I believe he is still going thru. He has found himself and have a purpose thru his family and service. So many gaslighting stories from his family. It’s so obvious now why the press has so much power. I love how he described experiences that impacted his life as a soldier and a protector of his family. I see Willy, Kate, Camilla and Charles in a different light now. Their jealousy and competitiveness in their hierarchy is not surprising. I do feel Harry’s openness has given birth to openness by many people suffering silently. PTSD is a silent killer sometimes slowly without being recognized. Thank you Harry for showing it in a different form and for showing your vulnerability. My main take away from this book is how much Harry has been crying out unknowingly for help and love. It doesn’t matter how rich you are we all need support. I also admire how he takes accountability for his pass mishaps. I love how he loves his wife and children. I hope this book help him heal as he goes thru life as husband father and life of service. Now we know why we love Prince Harry so much and this book makes us grow more in love with him. I will read the book again on vacation but I am very happy I bought the audio. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Harry’s voice for 15 ½ hrs thru13 disc. Yes I am old fashioned and I still have a CD player."
Gup,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprising,"If you have ever broken out of a dysfunctional situation, there will be aspects of this book that will resonate deeply. It takes tremendous clarity of thought to break free when everyone around you is gaslighting you.What is astounding to me is that the gaslighting is there for the taking for anyone willing to observe with clear, non prejudiced eyes. Somehow, the British public and the press has gaslit an entire family into thinking they owe their lives stories and their privacy in exchange for titles and fancy houses. No privacy from the moment you are born. Before you can decide if you are a singer, a carpenter, a surfer, or you realize you are gay, artistic or whatsoever they have already branded you as they are doing now with the current royal children.Seeing Kate presenting George to the world. I remember thinking, “not for all the tea in China would I do this to my newborn.”  To that end, it is clear that Harry was left on his own for decades without anyone looking out for his best interest. I am still astounded by the revelation that while still grieving his mother, Charles and Camilla fed a story to the press he was an addict and in rehab. Not only was it patently false, but it caused him humiliation and embarrassment.  Why did they do it? As they themselves relayed to Harry, because it would make Charles seem like a sympathetic father.Who does that to a grieving teen boy? What kind of a person? What kind of a parent?Outside of the complete exposure, every relationship you ever make is hierarchical.  Decisions such as where to live, how to dress, who you marry or who to be friends with, whether or not to have a beard—all things that need approval. No one is a peer, everyone is above or below you. How can that not warp your sense of self?This is evident in the behavior of William, a tyrant in the making. Unable to regulate his emotions, long known to have “a bit of a temper” his behavior is outside the bounds of normal. His jealousy and competitive nature is reminiscent of Charles’ own well documented behavior. Enfant terrible, indeed. He comes across as entitled, petty, petulant and very unlikable. I have no patience for people like this.The only thing of surprise here was Kate’s behavior as described in the book. Likable on the surface, she comes across incredibly uncaring, snobby and entitled. Knowing the hell that Meghan was enduring the day her father decided not to come to her wedding, her primary concern was to ensure Meghan understood a loose dress had made her daughter cry. Because of course that would take precedent over Meghan’s real life, painful situation and horrible humiliation. None of that rises to the level of an unhappy 7 year old, right? The illogicality of insisting she remake all the bridesmaid dresses at all, let alone four days before the wedding,  is one thing. But imagine had Meghan listened, the poor suckers actually tasked with such a thing, just to accommodate the whims of a true “princess”.For the sake of all of the royal children, if anything written is half as true as stated, I hope the Royal Family get some much needed therapy. Leadership cannot be commanded; it is earned by respecting those you lead. For all of their tantrums and insistence on decorum, William and Kate will never command respect if they don’t learn how to treat other people with respect.I don’t know much I can say about the British public. I heard it all when I was there—the cabby driver infuriated that Meghan had the audacity to birth her child in private. “SHE OWES US, WE PAY FOR THEM.” They have a warped relationship with the monarchy. Truman show, indeed.The racism, the misogyny, the bullying, the name calling—-all of it shameful.As for Harry, I wish he and his wife peace. I hope he stops trying to reclaim a place in this rotten institution. As a former Catholic, I remember the guilt I felt when rites and rituals passed my children by, beacuse I had lapsed with the Church and not longer believed. “Am I doing the right thing?” Well, my children are adults now, fully formed, healthy, functional and a delight. I absolutely did the right thing. Keep the faith, Harry, you are doing the right things. Onward and forward."
Brittany G.P. ,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An expertly communicated history, a beautifully told story!","I don’t know what I was expecting from this memoir. Actually, I do. I expected Harry to tell his story. I expected him to set the record straight. I expected details of his life and relationships that we had never heard before, some of them potentially scandalous. What I got instead was one of the most artfully crafted and evocative accounts of a life that I have read, or heard, since Michelle Obama’s “Becoming” and arguably more far reaching and impactful. I actually read along in hard copy while listening to the narration in accompaniment, which I highly recommend. One thing I did not expect was Harry’s ability to create such a visceral sense of time and place. His descriptions, particularly of his trips to Africa, the Poles, Afghan deserts, anywhere in nature were truly stunning, practically reverential. I could picture it as if standing at a window, overlooking the scenes he described.When dealing with the press, their coverage of his life, his relationships and more, Harry was unflinching and uncompromising in his evaluation of their practices, the stories and their ‘sources’. He addressed each one with the same honesty and no-holds-barred approached they have so often employed on him. Even segments that some readers may describe as “cringey” or “oversharing”, to me, seemed like nothing more than Harry boldly commenting on the many aspects of his life that strangers have, for many years, made themselves far too comfortable exploring.When dealing with his relationships, particularly with past girlfriends and most importantly, his family. Harry, bared his soul. He shared his memories, both painful and joyous, sometimes even outing himself as an unreliable narrator by claiming a memory’s rootedness in impression, feeling or even things learned later in life over hard, provable, in-the-moment fact. But where he has certainty, in the things that he knows that he knows, Harry handles his story and the people in it with equal measures of unaugmented truth and impressive grace. Harry’s descriptions of Meghan, his passages describing the births of his children, the lives they tried to build, and rebuild, are soft, beautiful and heartbreaking.I was a fan before, of both him and Meghan separately (having been put on to Suits many years ago as a law student) and a supporter of the Sussexes since the first rumors of them started circulating; no hiding that. But even as someone who thought I had a relatively decent idea of their character and their struggles, I was floored by what I’d read. I was moved by their commitment to each other and to “doing good” in the world and ultimately left with the solid impression that we, none of us, ever really knew Harry (not even those who’d call themselves the most devoted Royal watchers), and even after this book, which is somehow as restrained as it is transparent, we probably still entirely don’t, and that’s ok."
Pascal,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fascinating to hear Harry's perspective, for a change.  He's human, someone I'd like for a friend.","I didn't have much of an opinion about the Royals before reading this book.  I knew they had to follow strict  protocol, an environment in which I would not do well.  William and Harry always seemed so programmed.  That's because they were.  I knew Rupert Murdoch's tabloids were full of sensational propaganda pieces to make money off the Royals, which is why I don't read those rags or watch FOX Entertainment.  But I hadn't realized the Palace was sending propaganda pieces TO FOX et al as front page fodder.  That was the big take-away for me in ""Spare.""  I hadn't known that family ""cloak and dagger"" events were going on behind the strict ""privacy"" curtain.Harry's interviews, IMO, were cherry-picked ""scandalous"" bits per the interviewers.  But I came away with an altered impression of Harry.  He's very intelligent, well spoken, quick witted, funny.  And yeah, he's a ""catch.""  It's rare that I laugh when reading most any book.  His retell, from the prospective of a child/youth, is so droll, and I find it hilarious.  It brings me back to my childhood, particularly fighting in the car's back seat on a trip, as well as other youthful hijinx....so relatable.I have visited several of the Royal palaces/homes, the last being Balmoral at a Christmas faire.  I'd wondered what it would be like as a child to spend a summer/holiday/childhood in such an amazing place.  Harry delves into that.  I'd also wondered how well Harry and William knew their own ancestry.  Harry discusses that, too.My mother died when I was 5 (car accident), my siblings and I were shipped off to live with relatives across the country for 3 years, and we were considered a burden, especially by year 3...definitely spare kids.  Losing a parent at a young age, as Harry did, is going to affect you whether you cry or not, but it doesn't have to leave you in a hellish abyss.  It hasn't for Harry.  He is introspective, sees a therapist, and has a wife who listens and cares deeply, and he has kids and dogs for a jolly good time.Harry has provided his side of the story--I get it, anyway--and he and his wife are open to reconciliation with Harry's nuclear family.  There's not much else Harry and Megan can do other than proceed with their charity projects, raise their family, and enjoy their lives in beautiful Santa Barbara without fear of being slimed with abandon.  ""Never complain, never explain"" isn't so healthy for the human psyche, but royal hierarchy is a medieval institution.  It may evolve if, over time, there are enough chinks in the palace armor.  ""Spare"" is a well-placed ""chink."""
Janice White,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very insightful for half of the whole picture.,"I thought this book was very well written. When I got a quarter of the way in, I actually started listening to the audio book since I couldn't get my book out at the time and was pleasantly surprised to find Prince Harry actually narrated it himself (I didn't check the details before listening).I knew going into this purchase that I was looking to hear the side of a story we had only seen in news articles and end cap mags. I wanted to hear what he went through, how he felt it, how he heard and saw it. I wanted to hear the headline humanized. And the muddy truths exposed. Some might say he was too open and honest, sharing things that should be kept dark and hidden, but it balanced out the purpose and the pitch very well; he admits when he is wrong or doesn't know, and tries to stay honest throughout.I never really got on the Prince Harry bandwagon fully, maybe more doing a walk-by lol, but when I saw how the press and parts of the public responded to him singularly and them as a pair, over the years I started following along at a safe distance. It's too horrible to read every article or tweet, but the gist of it is really horrific, so I had a morbid curiosity for what his perspective has been and he did not disappoint.I was thrilled when he talked about his recent personal endeavors, and it is palpable how much weight has been lifted off of him by his 2020 decision, but it came at such a heavy price.I am hopeful the royal family, specifically W and the King, will read this book for what it IS and not for what some people think or wish it to be.This is the best letter to your family, plea for understanding, if I've ever seen one. The tone is truthful, but feels so much more gentle than I ever would have expected from someone who went through what he did. And of course we know things have been parsed down and made palatable to some extent because it needed to be, but it didn't erase the feeling behind it.I wish Harry and his tiny pod all the best and hope this book reaches who it needs to. In the meantime, thanks for writing it so anyone nosy can get their record set straight. May this book be an inspiration for those who seek to speak truth to their family and personal world, whether it's a few people or a large community. Being a prince of one of the largest empires makes things interesting to say the least."
Ebony Edwards-Ellis,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Corrects many of the false narratives and misconceptions about the British Royal Family,"I didn't know it was possible to care more (or learn more) about the saga of the Sussexes. After all, the tabloids, royal watcher blogs, and British morning shows have drowned the public in a veritable deluge of gossip about the couple since their relationship became public knowledge in 2016. And the consumers of that gossip brought a lot of their preconceived notions of royalty and royal life into that discourse, interpreting the (mis)information through their own mental filters and implicit biases.Prince Harry's, ""Spare"" forces its readers to check and re-examine all of those biases simply by telling the narrative from the perspective of a prince who would never be king, a prince who was treated as expendable right from birth, but forced to bend to the traditions and protocols of the British monarchy nonetheless.In doing so, Harry corrects many of the false narratives that have become part of public canon. No, he and William weren't the best friends we were led to believe they were. Not only did they never really talk about their shared grief over their mother's passing with each other, the relationship was marked by extreme competitiveness and, sometimes, even physical strife. And the story about Charles and Harry drawing closer after Diana's passing wasn't true, either. And, yes, many of the stories about Harry's youthful indiscretions with drugs were either greatly exaggerated or downright false. Harry consulted Will and Kate about the Nazi costume that created so much scandal in 2005. No, Prince Harry wasn't the happy-go-lucky carefree guy that he was depicted as in the mainstream press; he struggled with feelings of loneliness, anxiety, anger, and deprivation for much of his life. Prince Harry also debunks any ideas that royals always live in luxurious digs; after moving out of his father's home, Harry lives in a basement aparment in Kensington Palace before being sent to a tiny cottage so cramped, he couldn't stand all the way up.The book's most lyrical passages detail his love affair with Meghan Markle. This part of the book would have worked as an airy feel-good romance novel.Although there are a few TMI bits (the frostbitten penis), the story is well-paced; it never drags or sinks under the weight of its details. The prose is crisp, even stark, in some spots, nearly poetic in others. And none of the characters have that cardboard cutout quality; Harry's depiction of his father is surprisingly nuanced and compassionate, ironically depicting him much more sympathetically than many of the King's supporters.This book has something for every type of reader. It's part YA/New Adult/bildunsroman, part war story, part family saga, part romance, part tragedy, with a little self-help thrown in."
Anthony McGill,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gamut of Emotions,"The story runs the entire gamut of emotions for the reader - a young boy who lost a loving mom early in life, raised in a cold, obsolete institution where he was seen as (and literally told) he was an extra, a spare body just “in case.”  A weak father incapable of expressing love.  A egotistical brother that comes off as distant and incredibly pompous, knows he’s “different” than his “spare” brother, and displays an air of superiority in order to “control” Harry.  The father and brother and/or their staff knowingly or otherwise decide Harry and his wife can be sacrificed to the press in order to garner better press favors for themselves and their wives. This sounds like a TV show plot, but sadly it is real.  Harry does a good job of presenting the information and contrary to his brother’s claims that he’s delusional, he is very believable and comes across as brutally honest.  What I can’t understand is the reaction from many of the British citizens. Harry is a spare; his brother had his heir and a couple of spares, although I note that no one refers to Charlotte and Louis that way; and his father wanted to trim down the monarchy.  Add to that, they didn’t like his American actress half black wife. You would think they would be happy they are gone. Yet, they are angry. I don’t get it.**Harry, stay in America. A couple hundred years ago (plus) we pissed off some of your relatives and left England to come to America and when they tried to get control of us in America, we started a war and kicked them out.  They eventually got over it.  Let’s hope your family does serious self-reflecting and finds a way to correct this mess before your niece and two nephews grow up and are verbally slaughtered by the rag mags.  And thank you for your charity work.  **Charles and William, as head of the Church of England, be honest and do some soul searching."
Lisa,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Speechless,"What a read. I’m a bit speechless to say the least.I don’t understand why he felt the need to publish a book. Given there major wish for privacy. Was it all about money? Was it to destroy our Monarchy? Very sad that he felt the need to share intimate private family conversations with the world. Not happy if anyone else shares, but ok for him to do so.He certainly has a huge chip on his shoulders. There have been ‘spares’ before him and since him. But he seems to crave publicity yet condemns it on the other hand.I agree how the media have treated them is disgusting and shouldn’t happen to anyone. But I blame our government for allowing this to happen. Especially in this day and age when mental health awareness is everywhere. I don’t read papers. When growing up you soon realise the majority of what they publish is full of lies. They know this but continue to read it and get upset. They need to stop and consider that not maybe people read it. And even fewer would believe it. I’d seen a few headlines like the one where Meg made Kate cry. I get the need to get the truth out there. But what do they get from it? More press coverage? More press following them about no doubtDon’t really get the constant need to talk about his penis. Is he that desperate for attention?!?I have every sympathy when it comes to the death of his mother. Diana was a one and only people’s Princess. What happened to her once again should never have been allowed to happen. But she did court the media to suit herself too. I felt he brought up his mother rather a lot. Is that to sell more books? I hope notVery sad if what’s written in this book is true about what goes on behind palace walls. Guess it shows there just like any other family in our country.One thing that really got me. Him having to board a public flight after the death of his Grandmother. That’s wrong. All the wealth and means of our royal family and they allowed this to happen. Shame on you all.I hope the family of 4 are happy now. They seem to be happy and settled. I hope they are given the privacy and freedom they crave. But I have a funny feeling they will be never far away.Was nice to read about Harry’s life growing up. You can only imagine the life of a prince to be a spectacular one. Reading this is definitely not how I imagined his life to be. He’s still young enough to go and enjoy his life his way"
Jan789,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent book,"I highly recommend the book. Reasons are below, but first my quibbles. My biggest criticism is the excellent quality of the writing. That sounds strange, but: many media reviewers have said one of the strong points of the book is its excellent writing. Well of course it’s well-written – the ghostwriter is a Pulitzer Prize winner. The problem is that some of the text is so flowery and filled with literary symbolism that it practically screams that those parts are not Harry’s voice. Those passages were distracting to the point of making my eyes roll. For example, there are a few eloquent allusions to Shakespeare. But Harry himself, in the book, says he was ignorant about Shakespeare, and not much of a student. Also, the flowery, overwrought passages contrast with the rest of the book, which were in a clearly different and more natural, authentic sounding voice. Was it totally his? I don't know, but it no doubt was far closer to it. My other quibbles are small: Did we really need to hear about his slightly frost-bitten crotch? And some incidents, like the burial of the miscarriage, seem to defy credulity. And yet, to me these quibbles don't undermine the important part of the book (below) and are irrelevant to all the tiring media noise about whether or not he and his wife are attention-seekers. I don't know if they are or not, but who cares? The book is NOT a lot of whining about a rich spoiled brat, as some have said. He acknowledges his privilege. But he also rightfully says he didn’t ask for it. He clearly had an unhappy life in SPITE of the wealth - which does not make him spoiled. Why is he not entitled like everyone to create a more meaningful life?  He’s very clear that his biggest concern was the need to finance ongoing security and the book very credibly explains why - and that his father refused to provide it. He also explains very credibly that he was raised NOT to be independent or to fly under his own power – he was groomed to sponsor charities and give speeches. I think the most important element of the book – and, in the end, the reason to read it, is not the trivial details. It's to get an extremely rare close look at why being a real prince might be far from a real life fairy tale. In that sense, I think it’s even historic - how often do we get a glimpse into that or into the inner workings of a royal family, indeed that one?  I wish him happiness in his new life."
K.E.,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Touching and oddly relatable.,"I was moved from the very first page. This haunting memoir shows a man’s deep internal reflections on family, love and loss. He vividly shows the pain of loving a person or persons who cast you in a role you have no desire to play.I have a mother who likely had borderline personality disorder. BPD causes one to see people as all black or all white. Often in cases of siblings, one is cast as the hero and one is cast as the villain. I was the villain in my own family. At graduate school I once told a friend that I was horribly selfish. She laughed in merriment, certain I was jesting. She stopped abruptly when she realized I was not. She stared and said, you are the least selfish person I have ever known, give me an example. I was dumbfounded, as no one had ever asked me that. I didn’t have one to give. That was the first moment I questioned the construct of my reality, of my role. It is hard to know something about yourself with such certainty and to discover it had always been baseless. Spare over and over reminded me of this awkward moment in my own life. I think Meghan questioned Harry’s self perception in a way no one else ever had.Eventually, self preservation required me to walk away and not look back. But, to do so felt like searing agony - like cutting off a limb and choosing to live with phantom pain. Much trauma healing and a day came when I understood, I had not let go of my mother. She had never been my mother at all. I had a mother and it was me, and I had not been being a thoughtful mother when I stayed in silence, when I stayed for the pain. In that moment, I gave myself permission to truly let go. I came to peace.Harry seems very much the black child of a BPD parent and William seems very much like the white. Oddly, with BPD, the black cold generally goes on to live a more productive life because as human’s we do better overcoming someone’s hatred and disregard than when we think all our achievements are a fraud, unearned and easily shattered. It says something about humans that we do better overcoming being a villain than a false hero.In any case, Harry seems as if he has walked away, but I don’t think he is yet at peace. I think he walked to protect someone else. I hope one day, he rises up and protects himself. He deserves that. Every human deserves that.The book was cathartic for me and I believe it will be for many. The raw glimpse into another human’s inner world, self doubts and the journey to rise above it is striking. The love story shows that family is not the coincidence of birth, but the true sensation of being home. Beautifully written book. I highly recommended it!"
Jane,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a wonderful read and did fill in answers to questions.,"I wasn't sure that I would really enjoy this book but was curious about Prince Harry's thoughts on his mother's life and also his version of events with the press and the royal family over the years.  I found it entertaining and informative, filling in some answers to questions I had.  In reading some press stories, it seemed that even the most benign actions of Harry and Meghan became accusations of their disrespect, disloyalty, ignorance or jealousy.  Additionally, although it seemed that Harry and Meghan had stepped back to lead non-royal lives and seek their own financial gain, there were 8-10 stories daily in British papers about them (all the while vilifying them for not being ""private"").  It did not appear to be stories that were put in the papers by Harry and Meghan or their surrogates, but by ""royal correspondents"" or sources close to the palace regarding the feelings of the royal family.  Clearly it was lucrative to the press and possibly the royals to keep stirring the emotions of the British public.  What became clear in the book was that there were a lot of aides, etc, for the royal family who took it upon themselves or on behalf of royal members to put hit articles in the press.  I do feel, in reading a number of comments to these articles, that the people commenting have not actually read the book and perhaps those journalists hadn't either.I did think that Harry actually showed a lot of love for his father and brother and, as family, there is love but also hurtful baggage that every person has and continues throughout life.  Of course, there is sibling rivalry between brothers and, of course, many fathers cannot show physical affection.  Harry does not have that same balanced perception with his mother, of course, as she passed when he was boy.  I think that, in saying some of these things about his family, Harry's story resonates with everyone (although the enormous wealth is truly not something that many of us can relate to)."
NATE,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Honest,"I’m not a huge fan or super knowledgeable about the Royal family. What I pretend to know comes from a love of the show, The Crown and other books, but who hasn’t been intrigued and curiosity piqued by the drama of The Spare over the last few years as an actress from one of my favorite shows won his heart then was ravaged by the media.So after seeing the infamous Oprah interview and devouring the Netflix documentary of Harry and Meghan, naturally, I was eagerly anticipating this memoir.The last 3rd apart from the epilogue was pretty much repetition of the Netflix series, but the first two thirds were very interesting and raw. I feel like the degree to which he shared private and personal information even details of his substance use and his frozen member gave more credibility to the rest of the work - why share such details and recount so much content naming others if it could be refuted?What I mostly saw was a flawed human who truly stood by something I learned in my master’s program of social work, ‘know better, do better.’ He grew up in a world of privilege (gilded cage but privilege nonetheless) and as his worldview and experiences expanded his understanding of the world around him, he changed and stood up for what was right even when it wasn’t easy. I also thought he was incredibly brave to share his trauma. I repeatedly thought to myself - man he acts like a little kid; stunted subconsciously in some moments to the age at which his first trauma happened, the death of his mother - and later in the book a therapist noted that also. Then his coverage of the horrors of training and going to war and having to kill people and the psychology of that and the PTSD. What work this does in normalizing those feelings for a culture of peers that don’t deem processing emotions, at least not publicly, as appropriate.Overall, I thought it was very interesting. Very sad. Leaves me hoping his new life provides him with continued freedom and healing. Sorry that to own his truth, he had to push so hard against his family. And if I’m all wrong about what feels like the most truth we’ve seen come from the royal family yet; I look forward to the books refuting it - but only if they’re the ones saying it and not the British media!"
Shelby,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Believe the Press—read Spare for yourself and decide,"Everyday I saw articles about the horrible things Prince Harry had written about his family. I wanted to read for myself. And now I have. The press has taken a sentence here and there out of context and written terrible things about Prince Harry and his book. Reading the book allows the truth in.Prince Harry has not attacked his father, King Charles. If anything, he's shown Charles to be a kind, sweet man, who lives within a small world view that guides his choices. I never liked Charles before but now I do, and I'm sad that he has been unable to hear his son crying out to be heard.The press writes about this book by finding small things to blow up. Never do they write about Prince Harry's stellar military career. Never do they show compassion for a young man suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks who bravely carried out his royal duties.Never do they own up to the terrible way they've hounded Harry throughout his life. And not only Harry, they stalked and terrified every woman with whom he had a relationship. It wasn't until Meghan that Prince Harry found someone willing to go the distance despite what the paparazzi and press were doing to her.I know what it is to lose a parent at age 12, and shudder to imagine what it would have been like if I'd had to live out my life after with everything I was doing critiqued in the news.Any child who has asked his family to protect him/her or begged to be understood, will relate to Spare. Any child who felt they were treated as less than their sibling will understand.I realize many people are angry at Prince Harry for writing about his family. Why not keep it private, they ask with hostility. How horrible of him to speak so disparaging about them, they hiss. But the truth is, he's been privately begging to be seen and heard and protected, and his pleas fell on deaf ears. Writing his story probably seemed to him the one way he could finally get attention paid to what his life has been. Sadly, the press has given attention to the wrong things.I didn't see any member of the royal family as villains in Prince Harry's story. The villains were the press and people who worked for the royals who leaked and allowed terrible stories about Harry to be written.The royals who didn't respond to Harry's pleas couldn't hear because their worldview limited their ability to understand. They weren't mean or villains.The press doesn't tell you that for every critique about a family member, Prince Harry has plenty for himself. This is a man who has spent time reflecting on his life. He's been through therapy. Therapists understand that you're only as sick as your secrets.As a writer of memoir myself, I agree with Anne Lamott: ""You own everything that happened to you. Tell your story. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.""I encourage you to read Spare and decide for yourself what you think because the press has skewed what he wrote. I'm glad I read it."
Honest & real,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic self,Received a few days ago. I couldn't wait to read. About a third of the way through.  Watching interviews on his book tour. Was very intrigued. If you're a person who is trying to find their true self or has found their true self or not quite sure what that truly means. I highly recommend this book. I first highly recommend you read with an open mind. Don't let the negative press feed your mind before reading. For that definitely is not authentic self.I've been dealing with mental health issues most of my life as I believe true authentic people are always in the process.I truly amazed on how much I could truly relate to Harry on the process dealing with mental health. I shed tears from truly understanding some of the same feelings. Of course I'm an American so I never will understand or relate to the physical events in whole. But hiding your true self to please family something I definitely connected with. Dealing with losing parents way too early in life. I'm very proud to be reading this. I hope if his family do read this they understand where he's coming from. For we all walked or will the same path at one time or another. You know anything about mental health what he has shared with the world is truly amazing but also very healing but scary at the same time. But he's dealt with that of his life. I'm certainly on his side and very happy to know his true story. My opinion is he is a great representer of being able to take time to heal yourself walk the process of finding your true self.Thank you Harry are sharing your story. I believe you will help many people who are on the path with you or trying to find the strength to get to the path.
N.D.L.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved that he defended his wife and family, the most heroic act, even more than his military career","This book is a rarity in my bookstore, I wanted to know his side of the story,  as a person who married someone from other country, I understand the cultural differences very well, although I think he had to wait a while, because, after “breathing through the wound” he ended up talking about third parties.He had the right to write his own story, after they turned him into a living tragicomedy, many times through lies that made profits and fed many mouths. I believe this book is an irreparable wound to royalty from which it will hardly recover, if true, the methodology of planting stories will have to be evaluated, since the ""expiatory” or affected royal can now defend himself, resign and write his own version and, incidentally, make copious amounts of money and secure his future.It was obvious that his wife, an American, who comes from ""the land of the free"" and where individualism permeates and self-esteem is sky high, was not going to allow anyone to treat her like an ""old flip flop"". I praise Harry for standing up for her. I think that in the family context, the couple should have given the benefit of the doubt in some family misunderstandings and especially those that are only understood over time. I don’t fervently admire the stories where the one who writes the story self-proclaims the victim as if it were a virtue, here the proverb ""The first to plead his case seems right, until another comes and examines him"" applies, although surprisingly, he also narrates when he messed up and missed the mark, let's hope one day they will take the gigantic step of reconciling and clearing up the rumors, although he already left his story in ink and letter, hopefully he finds peace and the identity and purpose only God can give him, hope he treasures his wife and kids and starts his own dynasty."
Kaitie,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For there to be peace, there must be truth.","Somehow, I ended up with a large print version, but I didn't hate not having to read small words. The large print helped me fly through this book even faster.Prince Harry is courageous for speaking his truth. He starts the book with the death of Princess Diana, which undoubtedly has led him directly to this point in his life. Not beginning therapy until his 30s, he spent decades trying to run away from the trauma he experience so early in life.This is the first I've read that has actual humanized, and encouraged my sympathy for, King Charles and the rest of the royal family. The way Harry speaks about his father shows true love between a father and son. He highlighted the differences in which he and others had been raised - the lack of affection in the royal family, the heightened security at all times, the lack of trust in the outside world (specifically in their own press offices). I think that's what makes him stepping away from that life all the more brave. He legitimately gave up everything he knew.He was raised to never hold real employment and now he is out in the world, making his own way in life. Does his heritage give him an added benefit in doing so? Absolutely. But he is changing the narrative. He is adding transparency and honesty, a no holds barred look at royal life. He speaks fondly of his grandmother and great-grandmother and the connections he had with the two. He even speaks kindly about Camilla and the happiness she brings his father. Admittedly, I've been ""team Diana"" since childhood, but this memoir made me rethink the narrative that had been forced upon me, and the world, by the media.Will his family be upset about this book and the details he shared? Definitely. Should they rethink how they interact with the outside world? Definitely. Harry's bravery should open the door to reconciliation and change the ""institution"" for good. After hundreds of years of being untouchable and avoidant, it's time for Britain and the royal family to evolve.Well done, Harry. Thank you for sharing your trauma and your story. Thank you for bringing awareness to mental health. Thank you for normalizing these feelings that affect so many."
C. M Mills,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An incisive and honest memoir by Prince Harry the Duke of Sussex,"I sat down to begin this book with low expectations! Boy! I was surprised and impressed with this well written and honest memoir by Prince Harry of Sussex. He was born in London in 1984 the second son of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. His older brother William is the heir to the throne and will become King of England when Charles III dies. The book is long and gives an in- depth review of Harry's life inside the royal family dysfunctional shark tank! Among highlights:1. Harry believed his mother still lived and had decided to disappear following her tragic auto crash in Parish in August 1997. Due to helpful therapy he no longer believes this myth.2. Harry has an intense rivalry with his older brother William and the two rarely speak due to the family dispute. Meaghan and Kate have also had their petty disputes in the past.3. Harry graduated from Eton and Sandhurst where he was trained as a member of the Army. He served in the military for a decade serving in Iraq and Afghanistan where he flew Apache helicopters.4. This book show how the paparazi in Britain are relentless and cruel in their persecution of the royals and other celebrities.5. Harry and his wife Meagan Markle now live in the USA. She had a difficult time in Britain following her 2018 marriage to Harry due to four main factors: a.she is American. b. she is multiracial. 3. she is an actress who starred on the Canadian series Suits and d. she is divorced.6. The book gives us great chapters on the wildlife in the many nations in Africa, Australia, the US and the two poles where Harry has traveled in his exciting life.7. The higher royals come across as cold with a keen sense of their standing in the media.  My respect and admiration of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was increased by this well written and honest book by Harry. Highly recommended!"
Elenor,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 stars for the book but 5++ for chutzpah,"Four stars because I had to skip-read some of Harry's military broo-ha-ha, but five stars for sheer chutzpah--thank you Meghan. It may be Harry's story--his family--but he could never have done it without Meghan. A woman with no real discernible talent, other than the ability to swoop in and scoop up a disenfranchised man stripped of any ability to make his way in a country with a failing economy which has cut itself off from Europe and cannot grow enough food to feed itself.And did Meghan give Harry direction!: a cool $100M for the Netflix series: Harry & Meghan, and now this book that has everyone roaring with outrage at how racist, inhuman, cut throat and vindictive the royals, the British tabloids and those Brexiteers really are.But Meghan is merely the catalyst here. The rot had already set in wat back when Prince Philip had the bright idea of making the royal family more up to date.. A family that has essentially lost its royal mojo, They foolishly ditched the mystique of majesty in favor of celebrityhood under the impression that accessibility to their people would keep them imprisoned in Buckingham Palace with all the protection and privilege they could not bear to lose. Surely, we knew that when QEII died the whole thing would crumble--should crumble. If anything Harry gave us one last vicarious glimpse of how outmoded and outdated the monarchy has become.The shenanigans of the Windsors far outstrips the preposterous arrogance of a governor from Florida or Texas, the insanity of a multi-billionaire's acquisition of Twitter, or the ruthless self-promotion of an ex-US president.Harry's observations of his family are a testament to just how unreal and unworthy the monarchy really are: not very bright but easily manipulated nitwits living in a bubble of of prime real estate with no clue as to their role. The self-pitying misunderstood second son who shoots and hunts on granny's estate, but supports with a passion all African wildlife; the spoilt tantrums and insecure bullying of a first son; an aloof self-absorbed father; and the frantic exhibitionism of a mentally ill mother--this could be Yellowstone (almost as popular in America as Harry & Meghan). Enter a savvy, intrepid American: a feminist-lifestyle-influencer, network TV star, with a passion for rescuing the downtrodden and maladjusted. Its brilliant--thank you so much!"
Shay G,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Talk About Raw?! Wow! Absolutely Amazing book!,"I normally don’t bother writing reviews, also I usually don’t bother with biographies, but I was intrigued enough with Prince Harry and Meghan, that I wanted to read his story as told by himself. And what an incredible story it is! From the moment I opened the book I was drawn in and couldn’t put it down. The words flow easily, and the pain and sadness throughout the book is raw and overwhelming. I wanted to hug the little boy that lost his mother due to the callousness and cruelty of the tabloid press, and I wanted to hug the young man who continued to struggle to accept her death. The pictures that he painted in this book of the viciousness of the tabloids, I very easily believed, because I’ve seen the headlines myself (I avoided reading them because I never wanted the put money in the pockets of people who are so cruel). But I’ve never seen anything like the attacks directed at Harry’s wife, so relentless, with no real reason and no end in sight. Do I believe that Harry’s family contributed to the attacks? Absolutely! That makes me truly sad for him, his wife and his kids. Harry is right, so much has been written about him and his wife by people that don’t even know them. These people have profited from their cruelty and a complete lack of empathy, integrity or conscience. That the tabloids could line their pockets by spinning vicious lies, by treating human beings as if they have no value, amazes me. That the public doesn’t boycott them also amazes me. So I am very proud of Harry for telling his own story in his own words! I highly recommend this book. Once you start reading, you won’t be able to put it down."
Carol LaGatta,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Emotional Read, that Inspires Laughter, Tears, and Hope","I've followed the lives of both Princess Diana's children since they were born. I seem to recall many of the things Prince Harry mentions in this book. Not the behind-the-scenes things, of course, since I'm far from royal, but many of the stories 'leaked' from the palace.As I read this book, I realized the absolute courage it has taken for Harry to stand up and say this is me accept me as I am.I was more than a little surprised that the boys weren't given closure when their mother died. They were old enough to see her body, to say their goodbyes. That they weren't given that opportunity, it's no wonder Prince Harry was convincing himself she was in hiding in some elaborate scheme to have privacy.Many of the things in the press had to have been leaked somehow. It even has me wondering if some of the rooms where so-called private meetings occurred were bugged by the top aides/courtiers. It truly is a fishbowl environment, and to be perfectly honest, the palace should have stopped the harassment of all the parties who dealt with it. Queen Consort Camilla, Princess Kate and Duchess Megan never should have had to go through any of that especially after what happened with Princess Diana.Reading about his trips to Africa and the circle of friends he counted on made me glad there was some real support for him there. That he couldn't find that at home with his family is truly sad.I'm very happy he found true love with Meghan, and I hope they have a long and happy life together. Whether or not he reconciles with his family I feel is irrelevant at this point, he's had his say and hopefully has found further closure by doing so.Thank you, Prince Harry, for sharing your life with us."
dancebballmom,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brill (As the Brits Would Say),"Prince Harry has surely penned a winner in his brilliant, soul-baring memoir (endearingly offered up warts and all) that compellingly achieves three things: 1) Finally sets the record straight about the egregious manner in which he and loved ones have been treated at the hands of malevolent courtiers, a partly dysfunctional Royal family, and a rabid press; 2) provides a marvelous discourse on British History; and 3) Makes a strong case for a more tolerant and inclusive monarchy in which I would argue that the best person to lead it forward would be none other than a prodigal Prince Harry himself. In fact, many of the well-respected journalists and reviewers who are presently falling all over themselves with the “blah, blah, blah how could he write about his family in the manner blah, blah, blah” might want to do a re-read.I had no idea what the Duke of Sussex, a man of extraordinary courage and character has truly had to endure over the years. I fell hook, line, and sinker for those invidious tabloid headlines while waiting to check out at Wegmans. How, I wondered, could the highly intelligent Meghan Markle not know what she was marrying into and why did she force her husband into leaving behind the country he had served so admirably? I now know better. And you will, too.That a beloved husband, father, son, grandson, great-grandson, cousin, uncle, nephew, and mate who rose to the rank of Army Captain with two tours of duty in Afghanistan over 10 years of service could be referred to by the pejorative term, “spare,” is simply heartbreaking. That Prince Harry went on to launch the Invictus Games to support the emotional and physical recovery of innumerable wounded soldiers, became a patron of the WellChild charity that provides care to children with complex needs, and then co-founded Sentebale alongside Prince Seesio, which helps children and young people living with HIV in Lesotho and Batswana speaks volumes. Is there anyone more qualified to lead the British people than a man of this selfless courage and compassion?A 2021 Reuters poll reveals that young people in Britain today “no longer think the country should keep the monarchy and…want an elected head of state.” I suspect their antipathy stems less from a desire to change the government than from a generalized disgust over the unethical behaviors exhibited by so many in leadership positions in the monarchy who seem to feel that their titles give them carte blanche to behave in scurrilous ways. I will share that my opinion of King Charles was actually elevated after reading Spare, whereas I’d rather dislike being a British citizen under the reign of the present disingenuous heir.Yes, the monarchy is a beleaguered institution at the moment. Imagine how things might improve, however, if a war-decorated member of its very own with a more enlightened worldview returned to lead its people with a strong moral compass, profound sense of duty and decency, transparency, and fabulous self-effacing sense of humor? With Britain's much-to-be-revered history dating back nearly 1,000 years, maybe the Crown needs reformation, not elimination.End of story, I could not put this book down. And neither will you."
Isobel L.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry has written an excellent book.,"All the poison palace propaganda about ""Spare"" is itself proof of minion psychopathy.The Prince's book is great. A gem. Highly recommended.It's engaging, surprising, touching, funny, insightful, direct, uncompromising and compassionate.Prince Harry shows a sweetness about his Dad, Prince Charles, never known before nor suspected (not by this reader, anyway).His time in Australia, Africa, Iran, Afghanistan; North Pole, South Pole; Invictus Games; Mummy; it all comes to life and it is a much more more moving and wise story than I had been expecting. His own story makes up most of the book; family and palace trauma appear in the beginning and end, as lesser bookends.The blood-thirsty UK tabloid Press come in for a well-deserved smackdown for their ongoing intrusiveness; for being feckless, reckless, out-of-control money-grubbing leeches. But we knew about them already.More enlightening and shocking was learning of secret cadre of courtiers that really pull the strings--even the strings of the Royal family! Who knew there was a smelly mob of racist, sexist, lurking, lying, two-faced power-usurpers who kept getting away with murder, insubordinate in the extreme - to the Royals, even in person.Thoroughly unscrupulous and vicious, these arrogant ill-bred swine deserve to be the villains of this royal drama -- because they are.They cruelly push the Queen around, they isolate her; they forbid her to do X or Y; they isolate others who won't bend the knee; they play ""Hide the Tiara!"" and ""Let's Leak and Dox!"" They claim their printers are broken when their printers are not. They don't care when they're caught red-handed. They threaten, they damage, they poison, they run the Royal Show from within, running rampant.This reader kept waiting/hoping for justice to rear its head at last, to bring down the courtier conspiracy, using history's once-effective royal command, ""Off with their heads!""Still hoping. Hoping still."
Raymond Camiscioli,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Much better than I'd expected,"Surprisingly, I found this book to be a far better read than I'd expected. The best parts were his vivid recollections of training as a soldier and fighter pilot and serving 2 tours of duty in Afghanistan: the first as a quasi-air traffic controller, guiding aircraft and missile strikes against Taliban fighters, and the second as a pilot of the highly-complex-to-operate Apache attack helicopter, where he personally hunted down and killed the enemy. There is no denying that Harry served with great courage, distinction and dedication. Kudos, too, to the prince for speaking so candidly about his mental health problems: crippling anxiety attacks, depression, drug abuse, etc. When his brother urged him to seek counseling, he did so and began the healing process; his forthrightness about this period in his life will likely help many people (esp. men) who need similar care but are too proud or embarrassed to seek it. As for the rest of the book, he persuasively sets forth his reasons for leaving Britain: being badgered endlessly by the paparazzi which he still wants blames for his mother's death; desiring a more normal life for himself, his wife and kids; etc. Still, for a man who places such a high premium on his own privacy, he has no qualms about violating the privacy of his father and brother, monetizing highly personal conversations and confrontations that have occurred over the years. Indeed, he seems to have a real vendetta against his older brother, Willy, who is depicted as petty, snobbish, selfish, meanspirited and envious of his warrior-brother. [Note to Harry: if you're still in therapy, spend a few sessions working on that sibling rivalry problem.] In sum, this is a well-written, highly revealing and at times fascinating look into the private workings of the House of Windsor, from a top player.  While decidedly one-sided -- as a lawyer, I was reminded of the ""Statement of Facts"" section in a legal brief, where the lawyer begins arguing the case by the careful selection and emphasis of facts that put the client in the best light -- in all fairness to Harry, his family is free to respond to his claims. So, yes, I would recommend reading Harry's book. It's as a close to the ""truth"" about royalty as we're ever going to get."
RCTNYC,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Read it - It’s True, and Sad.","My criticism is that the writing and language are somewhat repetitive - but that’s the ghostwriter’s fault, not Harry’s. He is clearly a bright, nice, ordinary guy who was tortured by a system that neither he nor his family could (or can) control. His story is heartbreaking, funny at times, and an eye-opening journey through the inner workings of “the Firm.”Apparently, despite the many perks, it’s no fun being a prince of the realm. You are told where to go, who you are and what you must do - all with a heard of jackals, the gutter media, on your trail. Plus, you are sure that it is they who killed your mother. (Harry may be right. The driver was driving too fast, and Diana should have been wearing a seatbelt - but given their tactics, it is not unlikely that the paparazzi got too close to the Mercedes on their motorbikes and also blinded the driver with camera flashes, thereby causing him to lose control.)Although the other side of the story is not told - by Harry - it sounds as though the Palace fights to protect the sovereign and direct heirs, and does so, if need be, at everyone else’s expense. Harry’s account is first-hand and convincing; he’s seen how the Palace PR team and courtiers work. That his father may have been complicit is something he still denies, although it is unlikely that Camilla, or anyone else in that family, makes a move w/o Charles’ approval.Having read most of this book - I’ll finish it tonight - I conclude that, while being a wealthy aristocrat may have its attractions, belonging to the royal family, direct heir or not, definitely is a bummer. I credit Harry for trying to figure out who he really is as an human and lead a life that brings him satisfaction and joy. As for the other Windsors, Harry is right; they are more to be pitied than hated or envied.The gutter media, however, is another story. I guess that, so long as people believe garbage, the gutter press will continue to flourish. Perhaps it’s time that, instead of “negotiating,” or following the policy, “never complain, never explain,” the Palace should tell the tabloids to go to blazes - and sue. ."
Little Girlie,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heyoka Empath:,"I don't know how I got through this beautiful book, however,  I did. He owes me boxes of Tissues and God owes me my tears back so that I am not depleted of water. This was an exceptional book how would I expect any less out of someone with so much Love, Empathy, Respect, and Compassion. I don't know how he got this done I don't think I would have been able to stay as positive about things as he did. He kept this positive instead of getting negative as some do about the issues he faced and the trials he had. I give him all the credit for that, it is not easy to do sometimes.  We both come from dysfunctional families, but then again who doesn't? We are stronger for it and many of us turn out well. I don't know how sometimes. I have been following this family since the Queen's children were young, this has been one of my favorite subjects to read about and follow. I have a large ancestral map on my wall so that I can keep track of who I am reading about next and where they stood in the history of it all. When Diana come into the family I loved her from the beginning, seeing a bit of myself in her and then when the boys were born I followed all that I could get my hands on about them both. I always loved Harry, and thought he the most like his mummy and I also took after my mommy. Seeing the way he grew up and the things he went through broke my heart and when I read this beautiful book, it broke my heart even more, reading it and being up close with it for 4 days was just wonderful. To think that I was reading a book that he actually wrote, his words, his feelings, and all that he went through it was a beautiful, sadness. I am glad that he is now married to the love of his life and has two beautiful children. I am also glad that he was, like me, and not afraid to confront his thoughts, hurts,  and feelings and to get help, but mainly to also help others along the way with his story. He is a Heyoka Empath ( Native American - Lakota Sioux ) I wish for the family to continue with a peaceful and wonderful life, and to cherish each other and love all as you both always have. I loved this book and will cherish it for the rest of my life. Please read and enjoy having something special in your hands that was written by the little boy we used to all try and watch as much as we could. Now a man, not a spare as Meghan said but a real MAN!! If there is one thing about this book it is Harry showing all his sides, his fears, his joys and his sorrows to the world. I thank you very much for the privilege of being able to read your beautiful story."
yaremispf,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"As an American who has read all the gossip articles leading up to this book, I am so glad I gave myself the chance to read his side. This book is such a beautiful, but tragic, journey through Harry’s life. Hollywood has always portrayed royals as cold and detached, but it broke my heart how a 12 year old boy could be left alone in his room shortly after hearing about his mother’s accident. No one offering comfort or a simple hug. How different may have things been had he been shown love. It’s evident that this moment drastically altered his life and views. I don’t blame him for his hatred of the media, and I found myself hating them also. It was eye opening when I came across the passages that were recently distorted in the news to make it controversial. I must admit that it’s evident that in Harry’s eyes Megan can do no wrong. His love is such that he simply can only see perfection. However, no one is perfect. She can’t be as perfect as he describes her to be. That makes you wonder if there is some grain of truth to stories of her character. The way it was evident that his family believed these thing. I suspect there is some truth, but the media was so hateful, and his view of them so justifiably negative, that there simply was no way for him to see the possibility. The writer did an incredible job. I am usually not a fan of autobiographies and I couldn’t put it down. My only wish is that somehow, the brothers find peace, and forgiveness. It’s evident they love each other very much."
A. Brown,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A brave story of grief and trauma's impact and healing from it,"Here's what I got from the book.The members of the royal family are human beings. Sure, their accident of birth places them in a very entitled life where they don't need to confront their biases because, after all, they are royals and live a life of privilege. This book breaks through the mystique and aura around a sheltered life and shows us they are all human with the same emotional dysfunction as many of us share. While we can address our mental health and needs privately, the bubble in which they live, while at once private, is also not.As a child, he was not able to grieve fully for the tragic loss of his mother. Children suffer.  We have moved into a world where we can now talk about and seek counseling for grief, trauma, and so one without stigma. We are so much more open about things that the previous generations were - to the better. Unfortunately, the royal family had not seemed to get that message when Harry and William needed it most - after the loss of their mother. It's clear he carries it still and he shares openly how it colored his life choices.I am a specialist in Human Design and pulled up Harry's chart out of curiosity. He is here to be transformative, to have an impact on the world and be a channel for this transformation. He had done it with the Invitcus Games and his dedication to wounder veterans and to the natural world. He searched and is living his purpose - to convey truth in his experiences in the hopes of impacting someone who needs it. If you listen to his words, in the book and in interviews, he is clear he is telling his story, his truth. After all, isn't that all any of us have? There are other truths to be sure - those of his brother and father as just two. It isn't our business to pry into their truths. Accept that this is Harry's truth and hope that those he loves can see it and accept it and work on healing it.The book caused me to ask how can you have truth when publicly, intentionally, hurtfully, shamefully and uncaringly, tabloid media presses over and over with misinformation, the twisting of the story, the inflammatory headlines and doctored photos that are ever present? We all hate when a lie is told about us but it may be one or two and even if more, it doesn't necessarily have life-altering consequences. Harry clearly tries to show us how the lies have placed so many people in jeopardy just because they were and are part of his life. Like the time he had to be pulled off of active duty because the media had let it be known where he was and it emboldened the Taliban who saw him as the BIG kill.I'm glad I read it. I see a deeply wounded young man who needed affection and love, searched for it, and finally found it. I see someone who is deeply committed to healing in the world and who is willing to put himself out there in the hopes he can help others. I see someone trying to have some normalcy in his life. I pray this next chapter of his life brings him some peace that is overdue."
J. Bourke,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceptional, Enlightening Read","This is an honest, heartfelt account of the life of Prince Harry and his unique challenges in claiming his true self, his freedom, and the love of his life.  He is forthright about his feelings of the profound loss of his mother, his inability to grieve, and the impact of an emotionally distant father and family. He freely admits his mistakes, choices, and insecurities and in doing so allows the reader to feel his pulse — the heartbeat of an extraordinary and courageous man.  He provides an account — previously diminished, distorted, fabricated, manipulated or controlled by the British tabloids and their palace cohorts and the Royal family — of the intense and often dangerous effects of the tabloids and paparazzi on his life, his wife Meghan and their family and friends. He explains in detail how this bizarre, dysfunctional relationship between the palace staff and the Royal family have with the tabloids functions, who benefits and how, why it exists, and even identifies the palace institution enablers who effectively manage “The Firm.”  He does not bash nor condemn his relatives, as some might expect; rather, he presents a balanced view of his family, often with loving and affectionate recollections, yet is courageously forthright about certain family members’ behaviors, conversations and lack of support throughout his life and especially as it relates to his marriage.  In spite of all that, it is quite clear he mourns his family but they made it impossible for him to continue in his role or simply as a member of the family. His loyalty is to his wife and family; he is dedicated to protecting them and helping them thrive.  Further, it is at times terrifying to read of the lengths the tabloids and paparazzi have gone in stalking Harry, even during his combat deployments, and later how they were unrelenting in terrorizing Meghan, other relatives, friends and associates. It is also sickening to read of the outright lies, often fed to the tabloids by palace staff themselves, deceit and hurtful untruths spread to diminish the Prince and his wife in the eyes of the British people. Further, the book reveals how the Royal family were beseeched time and again to intervene, but refused to help, apparently so as to not negatively impact their public personas promoted in the tabloids.  The book ends with hope and freedom, albeit with sadness.  My reaction is that the book weaves countless memories, events and impressions into a cohesive, informative read. It is well written, compelling, thoughtful, introspective and at times even humorous and tender.  It is a fair response and last word to counter the avalanche of lies, distortions, insults and untruths spread primarily by the British tabloids and permitted by the Royals without protest.  I recommend the book highly and thank Prince Harry, aka Harry Wales, for writing it."
Alejandro Lua,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life as a spare is never sweet,"I won’t lieAfter watching the Netflix Documentary I was exhausted. I was tired of the same story of the last two years and I was worried that I would put this book down after starting which I never want to do but it’s happenedMy God was I wrong, I received my copy yesterday on the day it came out and I just couldn’t stop reading and taking notes as well as rewatching the show..Yes, I had times where I felt “okay..didn’t need to know all that lol” but overall it’s a story of a lonely boy who in the end had to grow up without his family being there for him like they should have, which..frankly is clear from every picture I’ve seen.Always a wallAlways a disconnectWhich you can tell when Harry kneels in front of people and hug them because he can’t resist the urge to be..well human.I didn’t believe this book would be so raw but..man I cried for this guyI cried because people yelling and screaming about “be quiet and you are sharing too much” are frankly ridiculousAsk yourself..how would you feel if someone told you to shut up and you’re not honest about something YOU remember as truth.I’m a firm believer of the truth is somewhere in the middle but frankly people are acting as though the royal family hasn’t been shown as cold and calculating..hello, have you seen the crown? Have you seen princess Diana’s interview and heard her tapes? Princess Margaret? King George’s coldness in saving his cousins and then his sons all absolutely ruined because of his harshness?This guy clearly is also trying to recover from his trauma about his mothers death and missing her deeplyIt’s clear that that Diana was his everything, she was the one who gave him hugs, who told him she loved him with all her might and wasn’t afraid to show it and when she died, he was lost.Like come on people and you don’t think they would have done the same gaslighting, the same treatment towards Harry and Meghan?But. But. But.One thing I totally disagree with Harry on is his comments on Lady Susan H and then Unbiased crap.First we know that Lady Susan was persistent in her questioning..it’s clear she was being low key racist.Second, in the Oprah Interview, it’s clear Meghan is extremely uncomfortableShe’s not okay with what was said about her future child and the questioning about it’s skinHarry could be privileged all he wants but I heard racism and his backtracking to me really annoyed me.Simple as thatBut overall this book is beautifully written and I highly recommend you give it a chance because after reading Diana by Andrew Morton, this was a nice tie in. And yes, the water works cameI wish the best for Harry and His familyI pray that him and his family do reconcile but frankly, as a stranger looking in, I’d say, move on with your life.Go do something amazing like I KNOW YOU CAN. Meghan and you can do something amazingDon’t go on and on about the trauma of you’re familyBe at peace with what you have."
Kathryn Lee,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent….so far.,"I’m about halfway through the book and what jumps out at me the most is that the Royals are humans. They make mistakes like the rest of us. Difference is, we are judged daily by the world through the lying eyes of gossip magazines who make their living hounding famous people and making up stories about them. A fuzzy picture here, a rumor there, one that you pick up from someone, somewhere. Doesn’t matter if the stories are true as long as there is at least one Royal to kick around and gossip about. How sad the existence of the gossip “journalist”.It was my hope that this book would draw the Royal family together. Apparently Prince Harry thought this was his only way to get through to them what he has been feeling all his life, his way of talking directly to them. (I may not be Royal, but I know what it’s like to live in the shadow of siblings that seemed blessed at birth.) I’m disheartened by those who seem to be flaming the hate and divide even more among the family and the British people. It’s just like here in the US, we speak of peace on earth while creating chaos.If I have any advice to give to Prince Harry, it would be “Let it go”. We can speak our truth, we can nudge it, but the universe will set itself right in it’s own time. To you and your family, be happy and be well. To those who are thinking about reading this book, I highly recommend it. Read it keeping in mind there are always two or more sides to a story, but only one truth."
Patricia Raybon,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything a great memoir should be,"What a profound reading experience to journey through ""Spare""--a deeply moving love letter to Prince Harry's late mother, Diana, but also a love letter to life. As told by master ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer, Harry's story is full to the brim with pursuit of full-bodied adventures across the globe, including his military experience and journeys to both Poles, North and South, and his forays on behalf of the monarchy and also personal trips across Africa, Australia, Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean and more.No travel memoir in recent memory can compare with the unfolding of these remarkable, sometimes near-death experiences and profound encounters as Harry struggles to make peace and sense of his long-standing grief over his mother's tragic loss.His ongoing love affair with Meghan Markle and their children is equally compelling. So is his undeniably great love for his Pa (King Charles), his brother Will, his sister-in-law Kate and, of course, his beloved Gran, the late Queen Elizabeth. Despite the fraught dynamic of the British monarchy and its impact on his life--from birth until now--he makes it clear how much he loves his family (including cousins, uncles, aunts) and longs to be reunited in a healthy way with all of them. One prays that will happen.As for the British media and the Murdoch effect, perhaps one day the British public will turn from the hysteria and lies, and find a far better way to assess and understand what is going on in their country and with the royals who represent them.Finally, as a memoir, big kudos again to ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer. His work here is masterful. It renders Harry to be reflective, introspective, honest, human, and still growing. It was my honor to read Prince Harry's story as told by Moehringer's compelling understanding and words. Well done, gentlemen."
NancyBB,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best, Well-written book in decades","I have just finished reading PrinceHarry's book - first reaction was personal.  I feel humbled and grateful for a family who loves  me and cares for me  and cares about me - the opposite of what this prince has felt and stoically endured since his mother died.  I live with 85 seniors and this book is all we can talk about.  For once, no matter ones politics we have all agreed this transcends that divisive subject.  It is extremely well written by the Prince himself.  It is a straightforward tale that is a truthful fact-checked account of the way decisions are made, acted upon, and by whom, and for whose benefit, in the royal household.  Especially for whose benefit.  His gruelling and harrowing experiences in his many years  or more in the military left a few pages difficult for me to read as a mother and grandmother of sons/grandsons fighting in the same battles.  The narrative is mostly serious and when he described - right out of th blue - an incident so funny that I laughed so hard out loud that I had to quit reading because I couldn't quit laughing.  One woman living in my community believes that this book will have the highest sales, except for the bible, in decades.  My friend is #284 on the kindle wait list at our library. (poor eyesight, she has to enlarge the font).  By the time my copy gets passed around I bet it will be in shambles.  I won't quote or take stories out of context in this review, please just read and deaw your own conclusions."
Amy C,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Read,"I’ve always felt for Prince Harry. That picture of him on the back cover just represents a little boy who lost so much at such a young age but grew up the best he could. The part about how he dealt with the loss of his mother is just heartbreaking and my heart was so sad for him and his feelings. Nobody ever knows how people truly feel, cope or process on their own.It’s sad to see how much things have changed since his wife entered the picture. He seemed happier and seemed to have strong and happy relationships with his family. That all seemed to collapse with her. Yes, I don’t know either one, but she seems to be the common denominator of so much drama much of it unnecessary- she seems to be sobbing on the floor a lot. Over dresses? Really? Everything always seems to be happening to her and of course her husband will defend her as he should if it’s valid. To me it seems as though she is always being victimized.She doesn’t get a long with her own family, criticizes his every moment she can and is always victim to something. Sorry, not a fan at all. She craves the spotlight and has no problem with the wake of chaos she creates and finger pointing that just about everyone has done her wrong.William and Kate have always been professional and acted with elegance and seem to represent their family and duty with all the world watching them as two adult people who represent the royals well.Hopefully Prince Harry will find some peace and will continue to heal."
Shana,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Memoir I have read--and Harry, I'm sorry we failed you","Even if you have never heard anything about the Royal Family, you will find SPARE to be an exceptionally good memoir. Harry covers every side of situations he encountered even when it didn't put him in the best light. You will walk away understanding why Harry and Meghan left the UK, and you will understand exactly how the Royal Family, and the albatross of the UK press, gave them no other choice. It is well presented, well-researched, and written in a way where you feel you are walking with Harry through his life--you are there.Harry shares what life has really been like for him and Meghan. He shows his true funny, insightful, intelligent, determination and ""Chandler"" side. It is wonderful to get to know him and Meghan both. I was shocked to read how William has treated him throughout his life, abandoned him, acted like he didn't know him. We are getting a look at the ugly side of this family and the mental bashing Harry has endured and continues to endure. The book shares how the Royal Family cut off security for Harry, Meghan, and his kids--and how they cut him off financially. It is by God's grace that they will have reconciliation, and hopefully that will come as a result of the truth being brought into the light by Harry's book. It's time for the Royal Family and the press to do the right things.Two other points went through my mind as I read the book. First, I was transported back to that September day in 1997 when we watched Harry and William behind Princess Diana's casket. I knew that moment that Harry would not let the death of his mother go without his response and action. I felt it then when I saw his face: ""Royal Family and the Press, you will not get away with the death of my mum.""Second: Harry is going through exactly what we saw Princess Diana go through. It is so striking and so sad that nothing has changed. Everything he is dealing with, his mom faced and even tried to tell people the truth. She was even planning to leave the UK and come to L.A. My heart hurts at how so little was learned from Princess Diana's death to stop the press, and how Harry's family still has not made any changes in their handling of the press and other problems. At the end of the day, this book really and truly is all about Diana, her death, and what she went through--this is Diana's story continued with Harry carrying her legacy.Harry, I'm sorry--I feel like we failed you! All of us have. We should have come together and stood up definitively to the press when your mom died. We should have demanded change--we tried, but it was not enough. We even should have demanded more change from your family--who is heavily influenced by world opinion. You and Meghan and your children should never had to endure what you have been through that is so well described in the book. The question is, what can we do NOW to help you? You have our attention. Just let us know! Keep fighting the good fight--by writing this truth, you are winning."
Maria Blackmore,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely stunning read.,"If you have some interest in history, you should know that historically , “Royal Dynasties” around the world are nothing but privileged family clusters, plain and simple, affected by the same toxicities, dysfunctions, rivalries, competency, jealousies and secrets as any other families on the face of earth.  What makes this book different is that it has been written by one of the members of one of oldest toxic “Royal” clusters in the world that had the formidable temerity of braking free and chose to emancipate himself and his family from that sickening codependency and started to live free.  It takes a tremendous personal growth, character, integrity and valor braking free from the tentacles of one’s family, much more if that family is the Windsor-Mountbatten dynasty.  The British Monarchy no more no less.  The book by itself is a good, impecable read, but Prince Harry candidly takes us with him through the unthinkable trauma, profound sorrow, grief and incredulity of a12 year old child losing his mother to a horrific car accident.  From then on, he also take us trough the unspeakable libertinism, corruption and impunity of the tabloid industry in UK and its unspoken contracts and equally repugnant relationship with the Royal Family in Britain.  To my eyes, Harry, The Duke of Sussex, is a modern day hero, making tangible and enduring changes in the world.  Exactly like his mother.  This book is worthy of a special place in your library.  Let your family read it.  Let’s do our part stopping the nauseating tabloid  trade everywhere and applaud and be part of this refreshing breeze of change ."
gammyjill,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hear from the “Spare”…,"What’s the best and most honest way to judge and then review a work of nonfiction? Do you rate the technical aspects of the writing or the content being told? I’m going to try to do both here when reviewing Prince Harry’s memoir, “Spare”.  I just finished the book and I actually found betterthan I expected, mostly due to the ghostwriter, J R Moehringer. He’s very good at changing Harry’s incoherence into coherence.Here’s the thing about Harry’s ramblings. If he’s even vaguely correct, Megan and he have had a bad time of it. What’s clear is that he was much more damaged by his mother’s death than thought and acknowledged. He finally saw a therapist after meeting Meghan. He is/was head-over-heels with Meghan. We’re talking about struck-by-lightning love. She reminds him of his mother and you can tell she rules the roost. Which seems fine by him.Much of the book is devoted to Harry’s life pre-Meghan. He admits he drank, drugged, and once wore a Nazi-armband to a costume party. (He had been encouraged to wear the costume by William and Kate…)The book’s about 100 pages too long for the average reader. However, I found most of the extraneous info more interesting than the stuff in the press. (There is no way that “early release by mistake in Spain” was real. The publisher wants to get this book “out”). He describes his time in the Army and fighting in Afghanistan.The bottom line, as I see it, is Prince Harry has not gotten over his mother’s death. Almost every relationship and achievements in his life have been influenced by this death. And, from that loss, Harry blames her death on the paparazzi who had been hounding her for years. The paps have continued the nonstop chasing the current members of the British Royal Family, particularly Harry’s young family.  Charles III, Camilla, William, and Kate seem to have come to some sort of “agreement” with the press and appear to learned to deal with the intrusions.Harry and Meghan felt their safety was compromised and the Palace refused to take their concerns seriously. They give that as the reason they fled to the US. Harry’s book is an interesting read, particularly if you’re a royalist. I give the book a 5 for writing  and a 4 for content."
Stavros Gkantinis,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry Takes Control of the Narrative About Himself,"After a week of press leaks, relentless commentary, and more television interviews than the rest of the royal family has ever given, you would have thought that there's nothing new to read. I'm stunned to say, you have to read the book, because no press coverage captures what Harry is really trying to say. He is really trying to take control of the narrative about himself (and his wife, but that's just incidental). We all suffer from a narrative other people build about ourselves: the nerd, the jock, the glamazon, the loser, the drinker, the good girl. All narratives are unfair, and most of us rebel against them sooner or later in life, and chart our own path. This is the fight that Harry is fighting. It's much harder for him because, unlike most of us,  people have a lot to gain from sticking to the narrative. The narrative sells papers; the narrative helps other members of the royal family; the narrative creates distractions for politicians; the narrative keeps palace officers on their jobs. He's trying to fight against all of them at once, in a really brave exodus. People have been reading the book as blaming the press, or as seeking the spotlight even though he complains about privacy. Yes, the press is awful to him and makes his problem harder, and yes, I would protect my privacy too if people were looking over my shoulder all the time. But his fundamental problem is not with the press or with his privacy - he accepts that this is the world in which he is born to live. His fundamental problem is that the discrepancy between how he sees himself and how the world sees him is unlivable."
Bruce,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A painful yet poetic soul-searching journey of a prince and a man.,"I have been a life-long voracious reader, but this is my first time to write a review for an Amazon purchase. I finished this four-hundred-page book in three days and really feel that Prince Harry’s story is a great example of how a person can experience great tragedies but with tenacity and time, that a traumatized person can find love, healing, and salvation. The writing is exquisite and the tenor honest. Many issues Prince Harry discussed, such as loss, loneliness, and longing for love, are universal. Readers can relate to his struggles, even if they don’t live in the gilded cage of a palace or are hunted by the media. I especially like his candid portrayals of the royal family and vivid descriptions of royal residences. By lifting the painted veil of royal mystique, Prince Harry lets the ray of truth shine on the constructed concept of royalty, revealing its complicated entanglement with media, politics, and family. In my opinion, the most poetic portions of the book are his descriptions of the energy of the African wilderness and the serenity of the Poles. The most touching passages are his many interactions with his father. The tenderness and affection between the two are so sensitive and touching that I feel no one ever portrays Charles as a father in such a moving way. In sum, this beautifully written book illustrates the difficult journey of a child outgrowing his trauma to become a man with the power of helping others. In the eyes of courtiers or the tabloid media, Prince Harry might be an inconsequential Spare, but he has the audacity to build a new life and identity in a new country and thus become the master of his destiny. Bravo, sweet prince!"
Grandma Bee,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, Compelling, Thought Read.","Prior to reading Spare I had just finished Invisible Child, Survival & Hope in an American City by Andrea Elliott.  It is the story of one welfare family trying to survive in New York City and especially about their daughter Dasani. After reading Spare by Prince Harry  It is my opinion that there are welfare mothers and fathers in the ghettos of New York City today  with more caring and common sense about raising children that was shown Prince Harry and perhaps Prince William after their mother's death. Who walks into a child's room early one morning; tells them that their mother has been killed in a car wreck, gives them a pat on the knee and says everything will be ok. What family marches a young child behind his mother's coffin in front of millions of people? What family allows the bullying to begin in childhood from both within the family and from without and does absolutely nothing about it? What family allows this bullying to continue? Is this family so afraid of Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall? Are they so afraid of the monarchy system crumbingly and then they will all actually have to go out and get real jobs? I applaud Prince Harry and his wife for walking away. I applaud Prince Harry for having the courage to write the book. Too bad the British public will not take the time to understand the breakdown of their own society. None of what has happened to Meghan Markle is ok. None of what has happened to Prince Harry is ok.  I hope that they go on to find great happiness here in America."

That’s life.""","This was an extremely well written page-turner. The style of writing and the passion behind every portion was palpable. While Harry talks about a language barrier causing a fight with his American girlfriend (at the time), the language barrier did not seem to be an issue for this American reader.I found it interesting the consistent negative connotation assigned to Americans throughout the book. As an American, these were hard to read and almost anger inducing. With Prince Harry living in America, his wife being from America, and choosing to raise his children in America, I would have hoped for a better relationship there.Trauma, lack of support, and immaturity seeped from the pages. I found myself, as a reader, pulled through many emotional reactions in response to these obviously deep wounds.""Who had the time to worry about things so unchangeable? Who could bother with being bothered by a fate etched in stone?""I found myself disappointed by how Part Two and Part Three followed the same narrative as Harry and Meghan's Netflix series. I was truly hoping for additional perspective, but it felt as though I'd already heard many of the situations and feelings provided in the last two-thirds of this memoir.In addition, there were a few instances where I found myself researching facts, situations, and photos as the events described weren't seeming to add up. The obvious slew of chronological and factual errors were distracting. This includes situations he describes that can be disproven just a few chapters before in his own memoir. While the memory can be a finicky thing, if I can do a simple search and find that Prince Harry once worked out with Cameron Diaz, including being photographed on a treadmill directly next to her, someone should have stopped such firm and damning statements from being entered into this memoir such as: ""Indeed I couldn't, since we'd never met. I was never within fifty meters of Ms. Diaz, further proof that if you like reading pure bollocks then royal biographies are just your thing.""Another example: ""An hour later [Prince William] walked into Nott Cott, where he hadn't been since Meg first moved in."" See just a few chapters prior where: ""We arranged a second summit with Willy and Kate. This time on our turf. December 10, 2018. Early evening. We all gathered in our little front annex, [...]"" It seems as though the second summit would have been well after Meg moved in as they were married in May 2018, leading the reader to believe that the original example would have to be at least the second time Prince William had been to Nottingham Cottage since Meghan moved in. An editor should have caught this and revised the wording a bit to make the timeline less confusing/concrete.These to name the biggest two to bother me, not including the Xbox, airline tickets that didn't exist, locations during major family events. These discrepancies cause me to question everything written. While I do give flexibility for memory to fail us, many of these instances could have (and should have) been caught and researched to provide more context to the reason for the discrepancy and/or worded in ways that express a feeling in the moment, not a fact.""So. Many a true word spoken in jest.""Regardless, I found this to be an easy read due to the wonderful writing style and I do feel as though I've learned more about Prince Harry's personality and personal thoughts/feelings from this memoir. While I am at a place where I don't hold anything shared in this book as ""fact,"" this memoir has helped me to appreciate the choices both Prince Harry and Meghan have made.Plus, Prince Harry talks about his todger quite a bit. If you're interested in that."
Michelle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,"""It was merely one man’s self-justifying, self-centring version of events.""","This is quite a hard one to give a star rating to.  How do I rate/separate the enjoyment or otherwise of the book against the content/thoughts about whether content is true/correct to say/should be included etc.So I sat on the fence with three stars.One quote from the book sums up this book for me.  About 25% of the way through and he is talking about the book Diana’s butler wrote after her death that was billed as telling her true story and it didn’t go down well with the Royal family.  He writes this, with no sense of irony, reflection or self-awareness:“Mummy’s former butler had penned a tell-all which actually told nothing.  It was merely one man’s self-justifying, self-centring version of events.”And that is what you are going to get throughout.  I can't understand why the press hasn't picked up on that one about his own book!!!I also feel the need to say I am British, I like the Royal Family and the Monarchy.  Wouldn't say I am a Royalist but I like the concept and the people including Harry and Meghan.  Was so pleased he seemed to have found someone he can build a family with, and I object strongly to lots of the stories and the way Meghan has been portrayed in our press and they do not do it in my name.  So I am not in the camp of they all must burn - honestly it seems so entrenched, it is like staunch remainers and staunch leavers arguing Brexit, no-one is going to listen to the other.  And that is a huge problem with the issue of Harry and Meghan leaving as senior royals and why they and the family cannot work it through I think.At times it reads like a Victorian melodrama dripping with over the top metaphors.  At times it reads like a pity party, poor me, I don't want to be Spare, (he doesn't quite say this next one but it is implied I think) I think I should be King, who would want to be King?He seems like a man who thinks his whole or 90% of his reason for existence is to be a Spare.  I agree part of his existence is due to that but not all of it and not him as a person, they love him, he is loved, he has repeatedly talked about his excellent relationship with the Queen and the Queen Mother, and the family generally.  He is part of a great line and history (which at times he boasts about) but from what else he says here and elsewhere he clearly is not just seen as a Spare.  At one point he actually says ""My family had declared me a nullity.""  In my view, no they hadn't, he worked himself up so much about it that it was true in his head.  He seems capable of ignoring everything positive about his life, his family, his role, his opportunities and focuses entirely on the negatives.  It all comes across as a massive chip on his shoulder and he will never let himself get over it and lets it taint his entire life.He is a man who clearly will hold a grudge forever and perhaps that is why he and the Royal Family cannot move forward, how many times did he feel the need to refer to the odd biro he got as a Christmas present from Princess Margaret? Honestly, it felt like he was looking for reasons to need a pen throughout the book just so he could refer to it, on and on.  Admittedly an odd present but I have long seen stories that as the Royal Family have rather a lot of stuff, they aim to buy each other weird and odd Christmas presents, so maybe just that?  But he holds a grudge long long after the event and Princess Margaret's death.  Is it worth a 20 plus year grudge and a recurring theme in your autobiography?  No!!!And the whole book feels like that, he has a massive chip on his shoulder and this book is his chance for a massive whinge.  There are clearly issues with the British press and perhaps other countries, and how his family have and haven't reacted, and the sheer volume and relentlessness of it is tough to read and even tougher I imagine to be the subject of and read daily, but some of the stories he mentions are so minor yet he wants a response to each and every one which isn't practical.  He openly admits he reads every one to keep Meghan ""safe"" whilst then cross examining her about the truth of each one in the early days of their relationship.  Did he think that would be helpful to her and his mental health?  His approach to it - and I think the grudge holding - is a huge part of the problem.  He needs to get past this or he will self-destruct completely, more than he clearly has  at times past.And he is a man who has never made peace with the death of his mother.  So so hard to do but his approach clearly hasn't worked and it has added to his issues.  I do hope he can manage to find a peace with it as her absence and his loss drips from the pages and again it negatively taints his entire outlook.On one hand my heart bleeds for this poor child/teenager/man who has suffered so much, but on the other hand, I just want to get him by the shoulders, shake him and say look what your head is doing to yourself!!!So it is really hard to separate the content from the style.  I was willing the end to come for about 100 pages, it was so relentless for a range of reasons yet his take on it is repetitive and boring to be frank.  And he seemingly can't see or take responsibility for his role in things.  He behaves like a terribly naughty child/teenager at school and in home life, giving us detail of how he misbehaves, is horrible to the teachers and then moans he is seen as the ""naughty one"".  This might feel a petty thing for me to pull out but oh, it is indicative of the whole book and it is tiresome!  Like a lot of the interviews he and Meghan have given recently he doesn't seem to have any self reflection or awareness of his role in what happens in his life.And for someone who cares so much about privacy of him and his family, the stories he includes breaching his family, friends and past girlfriend's privacy is staggering.And so, he says it best himself.  ""It was merely one man’s self-justifying, self-centring version of events.”Right back atcha....."
Barb,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well Written and Insiteful,"From this book I see several issues Harry hasn't came to terms with.  First, the death of his mother at such a young age.  What the press did to her for many years was so wrong and the fear history is repeating itself with his wife and children has to be on his mind.  Second, the British press was unkind and unfair to him many times over the years.  There is something wrong with a person who gives the press a negative story on another family member to cover up their own wrong doings.  It only makes sense to tell your story and then what dirt is left for them to tell?  Third, the royals were not as supportive as they should have been.  The word dysfunctional family comes to mind here.  Fourth, your position in the royal family is no longer as important as it used to be.  Andrew went through the same thing when he was ""the spare"" to now being #8 in line.  Harry has moved from #2 to #5 in line for the throne.  Harry says it doesn't matter, he doesn't want the job, but the treatment you receive as #2 is just not the same as #5.  I suggest not reading the media stories before reading this book.  Read the book, form your own opinion.  I believe you will find that this is a person seeking love from a family that refuses to admit they may have made many errors through the years."
urbnchic,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an Incredible read!!!,"This book was amazing and difficult to put down, I finished it in 3 days and I have newborn twins at home (8mos old!!) so I don't have much time!Harry has led such an incredible life, and details many things in his life that us ""regular people"" will never get to experience- most of it in other countries. I'm so sorry he has had this fishbowl life that led him to feel certain ways and he does explain throughly his feelings in a way that made me love his genuine demeanor. I don't know much about Meghan,  but I'm a fan of love, and they have found that together....He realizes he can't lose Meghan and his kids to the unsafe environment the paps have presented, much how his mother passed away, unfortunately.  (I remember coming home from school the day Lady Di passed away, and my mother was sobbing- a hot mess!! She couldn't even tell me what was wrong! She was watching the live coverage on TV).I would have loved to know what Harry felt his family thought of him as well, what were their insights on Harry?I just wanted to hug Harry so many times throughout this book. He was so truthful, raw, and honest, and had a great ghost writer who used succinct wording. I had to Google a few words, some of the British jargon, for sure, which I found charming. I don't want to spoil it for others with any more info, but there were many surprises and I'm sure it was cathartic for Harry to write this and get it out there, some closure and some healing for sure. Honesty, about his mistakes, as well.I hope Harry can repair his relationship with his family, in some form (maybe a book #2- how they overcame the obstacles!). I don't have any negative feelings about the Palace, however they seem to be somewhat antiquated now and maybe should use some more progressive methods to update things, especially their unconscious bias (I just took a CE course on this subject and it would be beneficial for everyone to do their own personal research on it as well, along with emotional intelligence.)Best of luck to Harry + Meghan and thank you for sharing your world with us, ... we so get it!"
jsh,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartbreaking, beautiful, brave and British","This is my first time writing a review but I felt it was important to do so. I was born in Britain (1985) and moved to the US in 2008. I met Princess Diana once when she visited Nottingham to greet all the children at my school. My parents were later invited to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen. She had invited many of the prominent business leaders around the UK to join her. I can’t say my comments are based off of first hand experience of the royal family, but I have some idea as to how the family works.Harry is definitely right, there is no describing what Princess Diana meant for my Indian family. She was on par with Mother Teresa. When she died it was the first, and only time, my mother cried for a royal family member. She had met other royals, and interacted with them, but they didn’t have the same beautiful aura. As Harry put it correctly. It’s hard to explain in words. Prince Harry is also a little lofty in his expectations of his brother and father. They aren’t interested in reconciliation. If Harry’s father put family first he wouldn’t have married  Camilla. He would have also put an end to Harrys misery with the press. Its also *long* been established that positive stories about Camilla and Kate are to be given to the press periodically, yet he thinks it only just happened?I also wanted to comment on Harry’s take on the British press. The British press cater primarily to white men and women from age 45 onwards. I don’t know many in my age group (or below) who “hate” or “dislike” Harry or Meghan. The younger generation actually prefer them both of William and Kate. They are more relatable. So if you aren’t British, take the vitriol the British press send out everyday about Meghan with a pinch of salt. We aren’t stupid, the press don’t represent our thoughts.Prince Harry’s book is heartbreaking to read. I had tears throughout the first few chapters. He maybe a Spare to some elements of the British royal family, but to many of us, he is his mothers son. And as such, her child can never be a Spare.I don’t wish to give too many details about the book but it’s worth the read. If Prince Harry or Meghan are scrolling though the comments by any chance, just know when it comes to my family, my children, my friends, all their children, we support you and we commend you for how brave you are. You have every right to speak your truth and every right to be public or not. Thank you for representing us."
Susan Roberts,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Everyone of a certain age has memories of Princess Diana's funeral with her two young sons walking behind the casket looking lost and heart-broken.  The two princes - William and Harry have managed to stay in the headlines over the years with Harry being painted by the media as the odd one out.  After vicious articles about him and his wife, Harry decided to give his side of the story.In SPARE, we learn that Harry has always been treated less-than his brother William.  William was the future king and Harry was just around in case something happened to William. (Now that William has had three kids, Harry has dropped to 5th in line).  Feeling that you aren't at all important in a family hierarchy can affect your mental health.  To top it off, he was so young when his mother died that much of his self image stems  from that horrific event and the days that followed it.  In this memoir, Harry shares much about his younger life, his relationship with his father and brother and how the press has mistreated him over the years.  The lies told by the press reached a fever pitch after he married an American actress.  She seems to be providing the love and acceptance that he's lacked all of his life but at the same time,  his new life has widened the chasm between him and his brother and father.  My guess is that some of the stories in this book will increase that estrangement even further.On one hand, it was interesting to read Harry's opinion of the mistreatments in his life brought on by the media and the palace courtiers.  The book is very well written - by a ghost writer - and it's very interesting to see things in his past that made Harry decide to leave the Royal Family.  For me, it was difficult to feel sorry for someone who can afford to live in a multi-million dollar home and not have to worry about where his next money is coming from.  I also think (my opinion only) that sometime in the future, Harry will regret writing this tell all book and exposing many family secrets to the world.  Will there be forgiveness or continued estrangement between Harry and his brother and father -- only time will tell."
JDW,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful book!,"Well-written and utterly engaging! Prince Harry gives a peek into what life is like in the royal family for a traumatized young man grappling with his mother's death. We forget that there were and are so many questions about Diana's death and until this book came, I hadn't given much thought about how that might impact her sons. For all of Prince Harry's largely warm recollections about his family, he is left to deal with the shock of Diana's death and the disgusting British tabloid culture on his own. I enjoyed his candid examination of his life and the determination he had to reimagine his life with a purpose and family of his own.  That the Royal Family threw him under the bus in their PR efforts to restore Charles and Camilla's slagging popularity after Diana's death and to shield William from any bad press is unconscionable in my eyes. That's not a family, that's a cartel! The book is about the resilience and courage it takes to face grief and dismantle gaslighting from the Press and one's own family. We have all been in a situation where we are more than what people want to pigeonhole us as but to see it at this scale is mind-boggling. I whole heartedly agree  with Harry that Rupert Murdoch is the root of much of the evil in the world. We know that in the US because of the attack on our democracy on January 6th but I hadn't really recognized that the same misinformation/disinformation campaign is being used to prop up a sadly anachronistic monarchy in the UK.  I look forward to more books by Prince Harry, hopefully on his  on-going philanthropic work with Meghan."
Erin,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very emotional but amazing book,"I apologize for my cat being in the photo but he is my reading buddy. I just got this book today, 1/14/23, and I am already just about finished with the book. I loved Meghan Markle since I saw her in Suits and started following her romance with Prince Harry and I just love both of them. I wasn’t sure what to think of the book but it didn’t seem vindictive at all. It sounded almost too familiar to my strained relationship with my family. If I could thank Prince Harry for openly speaking out about his panic attacks, I would. I’ve had them my whole life and felt like it was a problem with me. I don’t wish anxiety or panic attacks on anyone but I appreciate that he is open about them. It doesn’t make you neurotic or crazy, it makes you human. This book is written in a way that I can compare situations within my family with his despite the fact that he was born into a family of wealth and privilege. I find Prince Harry to be very down to earth and as I continue reading you can really sense the pain of the ongoing family disputes and how much he really does want reconnect with them. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone, whether they are interested in the royal family or not. It’s emotional and well written and it makes it easy to relate to those emotions. I plan on ordering another copy for my mom for her birthday next month because of how relatable the family circumstances are."
Zuri,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some things left hanging in the air ...,"What struck me most during the first half of this book (ghostwritten by the winner of a literture prize) is that, while it is Harry's story, it's not Harry speaking. There are too many erudite and philosophical thoughts thrown in. After all, we know Harry is not an academic and those sentences make it abundantly clear that someone else wrote it into the story. I was quite impressed by all that Harry achieved in military service. It is clear he is a doer, not a thinker. And abundantly clear from the very beginning is that he (as a young child) needed professional help after the death of his mother -- which he did not get. Diana's death so deeply wounded the child that the child carried that dark burden into adulthood. So when the tabloids in Britain started in on Meghan, there was no way he could handle it. I must confess, however, being South African, that I had no idea just how vicious and merciless the British papers can be ... it's simply incredible. Harry fell hard for Meghan, and it is clear that he is still deeply in love with her. For her, however, the stilted manners of the Royals must have been something of a shock.  She and Harry meet William, and, on leaving, she wanted to hug William -- who pulled back as if stung! (You do not hug a Royal unless you are yourself a Royal!)When the Harry-and-Meghan story plus its troubles starts somewhere later in the book, I  began to suspect that the really sensational bits were hastily edited:  Harry tells a story of clashes between him and William, between himself and Charles, or he shares a thought on Charles and Camilla ... and then veers away without giving us anything like what really happened. We still do not know why Meghan actually burst into tears when Kate wanted her daughter's dress altered for the Harry-Meghan wedding. There is a lot of vagueness about the internal family squabbles which leaves the reader to wonder:  well, what was said? What really happened?  Harry's not telling us that, OR -- what he originally told his ghostwriter was neatly edited out.There are some personal stuff he never mentions, such as why they were so mysterious about Archie's birth -- the hospital change, for instance. He also does not tell us why we never see full-face photos of his two children, although that can be ascribed to his ever-present fear of danger and the hated papparazzi.I'd say the book is fairly straight-forward and with many facts we already know. He does implicate that ""people close to"" Charles and Camilla leaked information known only to them to the tabloid press, but he never accuses Camilla outright. So in many cases he still leaves us guessing."
CP,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This one is a must for Audible,"I am spellbound by this book. The descriptions of his mother, read in his voice, touched my soul.  It is a beautifully written book, and it is easy to visualize him sitting by the campfire in Africa as he tells of his adventures and introspection.I think he had no choice but to tell his account, as the Palace would not protect him and his wife from the press. The tabloids just crushed Meghan, and I believe him when he says he got thrown under the bus. Like Diana, he values the truth and knows it sets you free. I didn't end up hating Will, Kate, or even Charles (though my opinion of him has always been low because of Diana - and Harry held back on Camilla, she got off too easy). It humanizes them. It's just sad that the whole family is so afraid of what the Press will say, that they have to trade stories just to get their images right. This is something the public needs to know. I really felt for Meghan. Harry loves her so much, that is the beautiful part. I'm so glad that they are free from the Firm and hopefully life will be better here in the U.S.  I hope that somehow they can reconcile with the Royal Family, but I kind of doubt it happens. It sounds like the Courtiers stir things up and have far too much influence. Really sad for all of them.Best wishes to Harry and Meghan, may they find peace and happiness in their new life here!"
Gatorgal,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fascinating, Poignant, Authentic","I’m American and was a news reporter for a decade in the 70’s & 80’s—when tabloids like The National Enquirer were embarrassing to real journalists. Now there is little factual journalism, so I can truly empathize when Prince Harry reveals the inner workings of the British tabloids and how  “the firm”  PR machine controls the narrative by trading scoops within the royal family. This revelation  alone gives me a totally different insight into Harry as a real person, instead of a tabloid headline.This memoir draws me in by relating childhood stories about Harry, his brother “Willy” and their “Pa.”Haters are going to hate, but I loved this book. As Harry relates stories about his schooling and squabbles with his brother, you almost forget they are Royals. His military service strips away Harry’s bloodline as he becomes a soldier in Afghanistan and matures in the shadow of his childhood wounds.It is truly disappointing when press leaks reveal his whereabouts and he must return to England.The memoir makes me much more sympathetic toward King Charles, especially when he calls Harry “darling boy.” There are no perfect parents and with that we can all identify.No one likes to see family secrets and foibles revealed, but all the negative reports about the damage Harry has done to the monarchy seems “much ado about nothing.” Hyperbole.Instead, I found it intriguing to read Harry’s take on his life. He isn’t asking for pity or even privacy, as that ship left the dock centuries ago for his royal family. It’s a memoir, his truth through his eyes, and he is entitled to write it.Perception is reality for us. We all remember our childhoods differently—it’s different for each sibling and their parents. Such is life.Kudos to the ghostwriter: the narration drew me in and kept me turning the pages. And kudos to Prince Harry for being vulnerable enough to share his story. As human beings, we can identify with family imperfections, squabbles, grief, and heartache."
Jeannette,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truth or Consequences,"I really like this book.  I love the transparency that Harry indicates in all of his dealings with the PAPS and the Royal Family Corporation, as they say.  I also like the fact that Harry expresses his faults and foibles and how he has reached out for assistance when needed from people that have supported him with his physical, mental, emotional and spiritual growth.  I admire people that choose to grow through their obstacles, and not just give up, even though they may feel like it.  I don't put celebrities and or famous people on pedestals, but really appreciate them speaking about their own mistakes and 'shortcomings.' To be human is a challenge unto itself no matter what the circumstances of one's birth family might be with their wealth, circumstances etc.  I appreciate Harry's honesty and sense of integrity.  Of course he has his own filters, but the way that he tries to also show his vulnerabilities is refreshing, especially in the global climate of politics and politicians trying to make themselves look good to others for their own gain and not really peeling away the levels of the onion to show the truth of what the onion actually looks like below the surface.  I wasn't sure what I would find in reading this book, but my motive was to hopefully get at some of the truth behind Harry, Meghan, TheRoyal Family and PAPS and the experiences from a 'birds-eye view' and I have not been disappointed.

Felicia Cook,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Honest, Sincere, and Engaging Glimpse Into the Quagmire of Royal British Life","Harry isn't looking for sympathy. No more than the pity he readily, eagerly, and consistently admits to offering himself in life, throughout the book. What resonates most with the reader is how the death of his mother has tremendously impacted him. It's a forever theme, penetrating the blind duty of Royal British service, the status of 'Spare' he would have happily obliged 'til his dying day, otherwise, if it meant servicing the Queen and the country he so clearly loves.In a bittersweet way, the reader is helped to understand how the loss of Princess Diana helped shape the bold, flawed, but, ultimately, insightful, and self-aware man Harry would grow to become, making him a better husband, a better father, and overall better human being, in the process. This is a man who cherishes familial bonds. It becomes evident what a shame and disappointment it is, then, to be born into an institution that not only exploits this as vulnerability but, by its very nature, must enforce and reinforce an incurious refusal of it, to survive.Spare reaffirms more than anything that the higher power the British Royal Family have given themselves over to, in a functional sense, is the insatiable tabloids, the agenda-driven media: the Royal Rota, as they are coined (though, there are independent others), as the struggle for positive press, public favor, and relevancy makes The Firm inept and impotent, at best, and insidious and conniving, at worst; ultimately, incapable of cherishing Harry in kind.The family motto, ""Never complain, never explain,"" has never been more devastating than right now."
Eileen,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and revealing.,"Having observed this family for over 60 years, I have no trouble believing everything Harry reveals about them - especially ""King"" Charles. I'm sure there was much more that he held back.I wish him and his nuclear family the best. The others will dig their own graves with their behavior and finally, that of the monarchy. Of course they'll blame him and not themselves,  or their ""firm"", or the tabloid press.It also parallels exactly what's happening in the U.S. but I'll skip that.I found the book to be well written and mildly interesting until Part 3. Then it became absolutely shocking, gripping and suspenseful. Even though most of us knew the main events - which are fairly recent - it's clear that what was happening behind the scenes was more appalling than most could imagine. I believe him, too, because it's entirely consistent with the past behavior of this family. They are *nothing* if not consistent. They seem never to learn.I can certainly see why he felt the need to tell his side of the story. The family pretty much closed off all other options. And I would go much further than Harry did. If this happened to me, I'd disown every one of them and never forgive them. It's that bad.It's for the British to say, but as an American, I'm done with the royal family of England. The current group is despicable, and I'm pretty sure they'll self destruct without any help from Harry and Meghan."
Tracy Greene,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Insightful, honest, loving, humble, pragmatic and hopeful.","When this book was announced I wasn't sure if I would buy it. But as I watched the Netflix documentary, I knew Harry's side of the story was important to learn. As an adult who shows much emotional intelligence, he writes with an honesty and a warmth.The book begins when Princess Diana dies. Harry shares what it is like to be at Balmoral as a child, how his father broke the news, and sadly, how difficult it was for both he and William to accept that their mother had indeed, passed away tragically. No hugs for the boys, no therapy, just keep on going and don't acknowledge the level of pain and shock you are in. For years this is how Harry operated, because no one really helped him through the grief. He was all alone.What's ironic, as I got this book soon after its release,  is the British press keep proving him right with their attacks on him. And if you're a royal watcher, you'll see the entire ""brothers together"" fable is just that...made up and not true. Ever since Diana died the brothers have been mostly apart and when together, not always on good terms. Even Diana's butler has been caught in lies (the ring story) by the truth shared in this book.Harry is his mother's son. He's there to shake up this toxic, dysfunctional family and he certainly is setting the record straight. The book is thoughtful, continually kind, even when he's revealing truths we never knew. He understands WHY his family does it - he just wishes they were strong enough to stop the cycle. Who will take the heat for Prince George when he is older? Will he learn from his parents or will things have changed by then?Harry has won the best prize of all. He has a family now. A family who wants to be with him, a family in which he is openly and demonstratively loved, and which he does in return. Lucky him. I hope that he has a lifetime of such richness, for the void of his early life clearly needs to be erased and rectified."
More of That,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hail Harry,"Perhaps, my title is a bit of a slap to the practice of hierarchy. Actually, never had much (if anything) against royalty but this book was eye opening. I'll admit, I thought Margaret (as a spare) and some of the men that abdicated the throne received a raw deal with their treatment by the family. However, until Harry and Meghan left for Canada, I didn't realize they were being given the short end of the stick. I knew they were being torn to shreds by the media and public but didn't know the family didn't have their backs. Not that I didn't read the gossip....I just have never chosen to believe gossip. ---- Unbelievable to me that people that aren't about to read this book are still wagging their little forked tongues against Harry and Meagan. Tells me that they aren't looking for any truth on the topic. They strictly want to help the media spread all the hatefulness. --- I'm not going to lie here, I do have a problem (yep, none of my business) with the vast amount of liquor and the drugs Harry has done. Yet, the poor guy being so traumatized at age 12, and not receiving the help he needed, I can better understand his wanting to drown the pain. I wholeheartedly believe Harry is loved by Charles and William, but they at times have an odd way of showing (or not showing) it. Wish Harry all the luck in the world in his quest to gain the kind of love he wants from his family, without feeling like an afterthought. I'll leave with this quote that I find fits Harry : “They say best men are molded out of faults. And, for the most, become much more the better for being a little bad”."
Diane Rowzer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling Insight,"I did not find this to be a pity party book, as many have said/reviewed. Anyone who is trying to deal with, and work through the mental torture of PTSD needs all the support they can get, from wherever they can get it. I had a father and a husband who went through this, didn't talk about it, and suffered for most of their lives. I admire Harry for facing this head-on. It takes courage, for sure. I found a new empathy for King Charles and some of the negative similarities he faced with the British press. It was enlightening to see him treat his ""darling boy"" with compassion, even though hugs were beyond what he could muster. Such a sad belief in how to raise children at the time. William does come across as more than spoiled, but we are just looking at one side, of course. I also read another reviewer that felt the Army information was boring. How sad they felt that way. Not only did this give insight into British training, but to the stamina each soldier has to undergo to become Apache pilots. If Harry was so privileged, he certainly wasn't craving the niceties of palace life while undergoing grueling training, and mental anguish. He should be applauded for this book. I'd like to think some of the other British Royals would feel freer to be themselves, and not fit some mold the Firm thinks they should be. This is a well-written memoir. I've read dozens and it is among the best."
Review my products,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is not about…,"I think we all imagine life in a palace.  I am sure we dreamed of being princesses as kids.  As I grew into my young adult life, I realized something.  We are all the same at the end of the day.  We can be rich or poor.  We can have dysfunctional families too.  Harry shares and I think he deserves this moment.  I am glad too that he will be able to be financially independent now.I think the best way to proceed in life is to pray to God that He will use our life for His glory.  I can see Harry going this direction once he has the freedom.  I see that he has a drive to have a meaningful life where people’s lives are truly better by his help for them.  It should really at this stage be less about things and more about others.  I think I see this in him.When I am centered on purpose, I will be healthy.  I also will not care about the thoughts of others either when I please God.“Remove far from me vanity and lies: Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? Or lest I be poor, and steal, And take the name of my God in vain”"
Kels,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!!!,"Can we talk about Harry’s book for real tho…1. It’s amazing to actually have insight to the royal family for once like we pay for this family who don’t give interviews except Andrews failed one 😂 so it’s amazing to have detail about the houses the childhood what he wore how he spends money everything I loved that2. How funny the book is I cried tears laughing especially about the mushrooms and the dragon I agree I support microdosing if your depressed or have trauma try them it works we don’t need to have prescribed medications first plant medicine is the way forward 🌱3. The media need some sort of law on printing false news how is it allowed in this day and age still? Should it not be harrasment the paps especially should have a dispersal order placed on them if the complaint contacts the police our young people get them if there in Gangs protect the celebrities more look at Diana and Caroline flack lost there lives and the media backlashed they faced whilst they lived was shocking, meghan is living through this shockingly still into 20234. If they want a royal family to continue with our generation writing this as a 25 year old with 3 kids under 5 they need to change with the times stop the ridiculous outfits, throw prince Andrew out, put laws on the media printing false news DAILY to tarnish good peoples names and also brianwash us & also stop the appearances for media photographs people in hospitals are really dying people are hungry show proper support not a media appearance.Other than that I highly recommend Prince Harry’s book you go harry getting your story out Meghan was the best thing to happen to you and I support you all the way❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Mary Rugger,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Engrossing, well written and informative","If you've ever dreamed of being a Prince or Princess, you'll realize after reading this book how lucky you are not to be!  Can you imagine not being able to go anywhere without a dozen photographers popping out and taking snapping photos (or having anyone you dated subjected to the same treatment)?  Can you imagine having anything you said or did misconstrued or taken out of context?  Didn't say or do anything? That's ok. We'll make something up! I have heard that this is a tell-all book that trashes the other members of the Royal Family. Not really!  Harry is actually harder on himself than he is on anyone else. Harry basically blames the press. Tabloids are daily over there.  A lot of hungry mouths to feed!  Therein lies the problem; They are going to go for someone so Harry and Meghan were pretty much cast in the role of sacrificial lambs!  Especially Meghan! The fact that Meghan is biracial made it even easier.  Harry wasn't going to let them do to his wife what they did to his mother, so they ran for it. The paparazzi  followed. Then the palace cut off the security money in spite of all the death threats!  Well, Harry wrote a book telling his side of the story and made some money doing it. They need it if they are to ensure their own safety and that of their children. I'm glad it's a bestseller!"
Anon Y. Mous,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,100% rings true,"If you've ever been ruthlessly thrown under the bus again and again by those who ought to care about you, then you'll recognize the truth of this authentic autobiography about a person who has painfully come to realize that his so-called family is utterly dysfunctional and hell-bent on sacrificing him, much as they did his mother. Whether he knows it or not, Harry's strength of character, sincerity, leadership, and strong ethics very much reflect what we loved about Dianna. That's why his father and brother find him to be such a threat to their own popularity. Remember the enormous appeal of Prince Andrew back in the 80s, and how he became ""disgraced,"" thanks to the tabloid press, so that Charles could prevail? Makes you realize that you're seeing history repeat itself. I have newfound respect for those who opt to skip awards of knighthood and the like, because I don't know how, in good conscience, you could bow or curtsey to such despicable excuses for humanity.The appalling hooliganism of the British tabloids, to the point that they happily jeopardize the safety of their own military forces, makes a strong argument for draconian legal measures against those who publish scurrilous lies for lucre or relentlessly stalk people. What a sorry excuse for journalism. It's going to be many, many years before we see someone on the throne who is worthy of leading the British people, and even longer before we see reporters worthy of the name."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great respect for Prince Harry,Much respect for Harry's memoir due to his honesty and respect for his family. Others might read it differently but it's not my perspective. I for one am glad to hear his side and what a lesson to us all re the  press . I too have often wondered to myself who keeps the press accountable for all that is published. A free press is indeed a necessity but not one that is unpoliced. The press needs to be accountable - otherwise it too becomes despotic. For too long the press has got away with misrepresenting the truth . I for one no longer believe in the press without question. Too often we are given a particular interpretation peculiar to that editor etc  instead of the facts . Further there seems to be no commitment to reporting accurately the facts of an event etc. Indeed Plato and Socrates might well have accused the modern day press of sophistry. We truly seem to be living in a post structuralist world .I respect Harry for his integrity and his desire to get his narrative out into the world.  He has a deeply human approach which is potentially healing as all families have their problems no matter their title or position in life. By being honest about family dynamics Harry is a potential healer as I sense no vindictive behavior in his words. He truly longs for his family to be supportive of one other. At least that's how I read him.
The Pediatric Profiler,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare reveals the effects of bullying on his life,"I know there are many people who feel Prince Harry should have kept quiet about his experiences and family. But as someone who has worked for over 30 years with children and adolescents who have experienced adverse childhood experiences (known as ACEs), bringing a light to how it looks and feels was important to all readers. For Prince Harry, the ACEs included the divorce of his parents, the death of his mother, and the stalking of the paparazzi.Prince Harry was able to show through stories of his life from childhood through his adulthood to this point, how the actions of the paps, as he calls them, essentially put him and his family in a cage. They were expected to be on exhibition at the whim of media outlets. No one was safe from them, which led to the loss of several girlfriends, as well endangerment of his colleagues in the military.Through this book, Spare, Prince Harry has documented the experiences that have led to his mental health struggles and to the alienation that has occurred with his family. Unfortunately, as the story shows and as has been plastered all over the media, the family has for decades chosen to suffer silently and to warn Harry to not try to fight them. This has also led to the family not being open even among themselves of the pain they experience from this life.I applaud Prince Harry for tearing away the curtain to let us know what has happened. I can only hope that the family will indeed read this book themselves (not have others give their take on the book). There are really no major skeletons in the closets, since most was known to some extent by the public. But his family needs to ""hear"" Harry as he tells us what he needs to heal and have a healthy family."
Jaqueline Keel,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Utterly sad but a brilliantly beautiful love story,"I rarely write a review for books. But I feel compelled to today. This book had me sobbing at the end. Honestly a good cry was had. My eyes hurt as I type this.My heart aches for Harry and Meg. It also hurts for William and Kate. Both kids grew up with these titles. Heir and Spare. Put two little boys together this way and of course there will be some rivalry. I feel they both truly love each other but I was taken back by how much pain they both still have after all these years. It obviously felt different by them but you can tell they equally are still devastated by their Mums death.Being an American, I don’t truly understand the Royal “thing” and it honestly it quite frustrating seeing how much press is given to this family. The British press is utterly disgusting in my honest opinion. It’s sad to see how it has pitted this family against each other. It’s obvious who is planting these stories to the press. Quite honestly I’m not shocked it’s Camilla. She has to redeem herself after her scandal. But at the cost of this? It is inexcusable. It’s like she broke up this family twice.This book was incredibly well written and I could not put it down, especially the last or 3rd “part”.  To see Harry, happy and so in love, is what I walked away with at the end. It made me sob and made my heart have hope. His love for Meg and his children is awe inspiring and for that, maybe just maybe it was worth all the pain. He is free now and for that my heart is happy for them all.Be prepared to cry, especially the “ornament” and his Mum story. Yes, I had chills. And yes I laughed too.This is a book I won’t read again because it is a painful story to read. I will keep it forever though. I normally don’t keep my books. This book is a reminder that there is a happy ending sometimes and being a spare is not such a bad thing after all."
Billy L Biggs,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful read,"What strikes me is how little I knew about British royalty. I loved the Shakespearean stories about kings, and despite the treachery therein, I was still shocked by the current treachery of the British press and the Royal family. When I first started hearing of the controversy concerning Harry and Meghan, I was disgusted that their actual words were being discounted by so-called royal experts. Rather than William explaining “his side of the physical fight with Harry,” the press started telling stories of how horrible Harry was to tell the story. There was no press or royal expert to fight the racist and horrific attacks on Meghan, mainly because they were the source. This book is Harry’s story. He had to tell it to counteract the attacks on him and his wife. I found the power of the press to destroy them ridiculous, so I read his own words. I loved his entire story — through the schools he attended, the military he served, his trips to Africa, and his desire to serve. I have a whole new respect for flying an Apache. The details were compelling. Harry’s life was privileged and deeply troubled, especially because of the death of his mother, but the reader sees him develop into a deeply moral, caring, and courageous man of integrity. Anyone who sides with the British experts and press must read this book for the truth. The family that sacrificed and attacked them has not spoken, The British press did their dirty work."
Grateful,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A moving memoir.  A truly noble family man.,"A courageous telling of his own story as Harry takes full command of his life and champions a healthy future for his family.It is said that the art of memoir can be a cathartic healing tool.  I imagine the process of finally opening up served him well to find his emotional strength from that place of vulnerability.  One can only wonder if his royal family members will ever be able to really hear, understand, and accept him as he would like.I could have done without the needless ""frostnip"" anecdote.  It seemed a bit TMI and rather irrelevant to the over-all story.  I suspect he might regret adding it in after watching Stephen Colbert interview him about it.  He seemed a little embarrassed.  Overall, an excellent memoir from someone who liberated himself from the gilded cage that is the monarchy.  He'll fit in well here in America.We share a language with the English, but our cultures are very different.  If you want to know more about that and better understand their generally poor reaction to Harry's book (and to the generally more open nature of Americans as a society - quite opposite of most British sensibilities), read the humorously written ""Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour,"" by English anthropologist, Kate Fox.  I guarantee most Americans would find it shocking.  I know I did.Good on you, Harry!  May you, Meghan, and your children, be safe and at peace in your new home."

Everyone makes choices in life, and  the effects of those choices, like a domino effect,but they should never take over the importance of life, and if so, should be held accountable.

S. Baker,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings,"I always had a soft spot for the little redder boy with the mischievous smile and my heart broke for those two boys as they walked with heads down following their mother's casket.  William always seemed so serious and even when he smiled it was not reflected in his eyes.  When Harry married I hoped he would find happiness and was sad to see the way the press brutalized he and his wife and hoped when they moved to the states they would be able to enjoy their life in private.  Then came Oprah, then Netflix and now Spare.  I have read many of the articles written after each of the above and seen both pros and cons and I have to say that I truly wish that after Oprah Harry and his wife had decided to get on with their lives in California, continued their charity work and raised their children in private.  Netflix was way to much on how great their life is.  Picture after picture of them in loving moments which obviously someone else was taking the pictures came off as a set scene for proof of their great love.  Very much overkill and now the book a few weeks later.  I went from liking Harry to thinking ""is he never going to stop dissing his family""?  Enough already.  So I decided I would not read the boom!  I have heard everything twice already, but I really wanted to read it to see if it was as good or as bad as reviewers claimed.  I thought the first part was interesting although some of the descriptive writing seemed to be the voice of the ghost writer putting these flowery words in Harry's mouth.  You could heard the difference  in Harry's voice talk in my about school, feelings, army life, etc.  In spite of that the narrative kept my interest.  However when we got to the slings and arrows at his family (but not the press) I felt that this was what many of the reviewers meant.  He will regret this later down the road.  It is one thing to argue and even fight with family members but when you attack them in public, especially when you know they will not defend themselves publicly, then you cross a line where healing is almost impossible to achieve.  I feel you made your feelings of anger and hurt known in the Oprah show.  This was way over the line and this book is no different than what the media did to you!  Two wrongs do not make it right.  So my three stars was for my disappointment in having to digest all this anger, revenge and false words of hope for apologies from your family when you know that isn't going to happen.  You zing your father for not hugging you when he told you about your mom but you know his history as well as hour grandfather's history.  You never talk about what your brother went through during your parents breakup or what his inner torment was as he walked that walk by your side.  You say this is you get truth but what about theirs.  Your truth and your brothers truth may differ but they are still your truths and not necessarily ""factual truth"". So until we hear everyone's truth I will have to say, ""enjoy your wife and children, do your charity work and save us from anymore about your royal family"". If you and your wife can't do that then I suggest going out in the garden and eat some worms!"
Terri Holland,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Poignant, Honest, Sad and Beautiful","I wasnt expecting to enjoy this book; after all the crappy media I thought it would be a laundry list of attacks. Instead it was an incredibly personal, honest and heartfelt introspective memoir of Prince Harry's life. It is beautifully written, by far the best memoir I've ever read. I'm not a royalist and find the whole concept of the monarchy ridiculous but .... I have been horrified and perplexed by all the hate spewed at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.This book explores the toxic connection behind an outdated monarchy and the clickbait press. Harry, a sensitive boy lost his mother who has hounded to death by the press and is rightfully angry and disheartened. His story of finding love in his cold distant life is inspiring. He's raising his children in a loving home unlike the brittle, hands off, competitive one he grew up in.I admire both his willingness to put it all out there and to do so with passion, introspection and hopefulness. I wish I could read this book again, fresh and new because it impacted me on so many levels. I'm glad he and Meghan escaped his brother and his cold, petty and competitive wife, Kate. Harry deserves better than he got.This book is remarkable. I read it in 2 days and still, a few days later, thi k about it often. Incredible work."
Holly Golightly,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a book about surviving a dysfunctional family and C-PTSD,"The fact that Harry comes from the royal family is almost totally irrelevant… The important aspect of this book is the story of surviving a toxic, dysfunctional family, and overcoming all of the issues created within that family.Survivors of a similar dynamic, will be able to relate to the various symptoms that Harry writes about – for example, addiction to substances, and the challenge of trying to remember specific dates and specific details without mixing them up, which is a common trait of C – PTSD.It’s a fascinating story of survival, and a great reminder that, no matter what kind of material wealth or resources we are surrounded by, trauma breaks us all down and hurts us in the same way. It leaves us questioning our reality, and questioning whether or not the people around us truly have our best interest at heart. It turns out, they often don’t.Some of the actual information in this book has already been shared in other formats, but some of the information is quite new, and will keep you engaged in this fascinating exposé. But more than anything, I found myself unable to ignore Harry’s exploration of the emotional trauma he (and Meghan) have endured for so long. I have none of the prestige or privileges of a Royal, but my symptoms and my suffering have been very similar to Harry’s. I think there are so many other people who can relate to this, and I know that this is something that is very important to Harry – to discuss the impact of trauma and abuse on our mental health, and to remind each other that talking about it and sharing our stories is what helps to heal us."
Robin Harper,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful and Spoken from the Heart,"I chose to read this because I have prayed for this family since the death of Princess Diana. I was actually curious about the well being of her children. My heart broke for them when they lost their beautifuI mother. When reading this book I can feel the love Harry has for his family amidst all of everything he and Meghan have experienced. He is just speaking up because of the actions  and of the false/extremely exaggerated stories from the press. He wanted to defend his family and protect them. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to if to hear the truth from Prince Harry's prospective.  He has spoken from the bottom of his heart. No one except he himself knows how he was made to feel.  No judgement here. No one is perfect. May God bless his entire family. My heart goes out to all of them. They did not choose to be born into Royalty. My prayer is that the press will give the entire Royal Family a break. My prayer is also that Prince Harry, Prince William,and King Charles can find way to work out their differences and accept and respect each other's feelings and each other's spouses feelings.  Royalty, fame and riches can not bring you happiness. Only God can bring you true happiness Nothing is more important than God and family. May God help them heal."
Kim Chadwell,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST READ! Written with class -written from the heart,"Having come from a dysfunctional family with favoritism and lack of accountability along with lack of emotion, Prince Harry’s story rings true for anyone raised in dysfunction, lack of emotion and favoritism. And, as I, when one gains peace and in touch with oneself, along with having other genuine relationships, the alienation begins. The attacks, the cuts, the judgmental glares, the accusing of being weak, all happens when one sees the truth, and happened to me. Early in his journey with Megan I “caught” what was going on. The bad press, the CONSTANT negative stories, and obvious favoritism to the one everyone is “supposed” to adore (the future king.) I saw through their plan to destroy the one who was finding happiness, making it, and actually successful without them. Now looking back in my own life, I really am the one doing well, happy, and have beautiful children and grandchildren. Breaking away from my dysfunctional family as a young mom when the cuts, gossip, and criticisms never let up, was the best decision I ever made. Reading Harry’s story brings truth to a pained journey. This family is designed to be a stage while a spare has tried to find himself within the actors.Harry’s journey is the classic pink elephant in the room with the family screaming there’s no elephant and you’ve got problems. When watching Harry’s interviews there is a rare genuineness. I wish him full happiness. How sad so many have jumped on the trains of opinion without ever walking a mile in his pair of spare shoes.May we each root for him to make it - he’s a gem…just like his mother."
BostonMom,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't believe the media's sensationalized headlines. Read the book!,"You may not like everything written in this book but if you can come at it with an open mind and not get so hung up on little details, it's an extraordinarily compelling read! I came at it from several angles. My children lost their father when they were very young too so was interested in Harry's journey through grief. My children were adopted internationally so like Meghan had their lives impacted by how they fit into 2 different worlds. I also work for a global Fortune 100 company that's done a lot of work over the last many years in a very thoughtful approach across every aspect of the company around diversity & inclusion so have been interested in how an institution like the monarchy has dealt with such a changing world (sadly, it hasn't). And I've studied the media, the toxicity that seems to be everywhere now and the impact that's having on society.  Being a mother I'm also interested on how some children have much higher Emotional IQs than others. I'm also American but work mainly with Brits so love to see the richness across cultures. Anyway, I found the book fascinating and couldn't put it down/stop listening. While a very personal story, it touches on many important topics so should make us all think. It is incredibly sad though too to see the breakdown of any family. I hope one day they all can heal."
Sylvia Hawley,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book merits appreciation and acclaim,"I predict memoir will become a classic with enduring value for readers, historians, students of monarchy, students of psychology and personal development, students of emotional health, students of civic life and governance. In his last line, Prince Harry thanks us for wanting to know his story, while I had just spent my entire read thanking him in my heart and mind for telling it.It is so unique that I cannot think of a work in history or literature to compare it to -- when I thought of what I expect to be its enduring importance, I said to myself, better than Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer and they were fiction!!!! Yet they were boy's stories set in difficult times with social themes and drama very important to human history.This story is very important to human history. I think the best most of us can do for this young family is wish them well and try to respect their privacy.The book might irritate the royal family but I would note that the author expresses his love and affection and wish for family belonging, reconciliation and goodwill.Certainly, it would be a much happier solution for little cousins who might be missing out on knowing one another.O yes, and the celebrity photographers should face restraining orders that require them to keep 500 meters distance and use their telephoto lenses. They could have exceptions for celebrities or royals who want to meet with them and make appointments."
S Chapel Reviews,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry Shares his Memoir,"Prince Harry takes his readers back to his early years just before his Mother the late Princess Diana died in a horrible auto accident. We are taken through his school years to his time that he served in the British Army then on through the years beyond to the present. I thought his writing was very good but his use of the F four lettered word made its way into this book often. The story dragged somewhat in his school years and for a small percentage of my reading time I felt bored by the parties and lifestyle he lived but for the most part of the book I enjoyed reading it and felt that I got to understand Harry better . His mother dying so suddenly and tragically because of the media chasing her car left Harry , at a tender age, unable to except her death. This book centers on how he came to except his mother’s death and how he and anyone he knows personally are harassed by the media.I believe that Prince Harry was honest and truthful in this memoir of his life and about his relationship with his family. I’m glad that I read this book because it answered a lot of questions I had about why he and Meghan left England. I usually read Fiction and Biographies and Memoirs aren’t my genre . I wanted to read this book because of my curiosity with the royal family. Those negative post on Facebook that the Peps post sound like elementary school children tattling on one another and idle gossip . I couldn’t put this book down for most of the time I spent reading it.I purchased my own copy of this book. My comments are my honest opinion of how I felt about my reading experiences with the book."
Deborah Vanessa Ramirez Correa,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"honest, heartbreaking and sometimes hilarious","I always found Prince Harry interesting, he always stood out to me in pictures, probably the proximity in age. My mom was a huge, huge fan of Lady Di so I was familiar. Growing up, I remember the press always made him out to be the naughty younger brother, to me he was like the Home Alone kid. I definitely liked him, but reading his story made feel very saddened. He’s a bit childlike at times, which is understandable. I truly empathize and the book changed my perspective.To be 100% honest, I bought the book out of curiosity because the media, even the ones who seem objective like the NYT, try so hard to tell us we should move on, that Meghan and Harry have nothing to say. I agree Meghan has nothing to say. I’m sorry Meghan, your story’s just meh.Prince Harry though is another story. He is no Shakespeare, truth be told. But wow… a kid with all of that wealth and privilege who was so unloved. He doesn’t say it, but that’s it. He was unloved, to him the only person who truly loved him was his mom (and probably Meghan now). He lost that person who truly, truly loved him. How can anyone not expect him to overreact when he feels like he will lose the second person who he thinks loves him most? Of course he will fight to protect it. He talks about his mental health, he is not perfect, this is a flawed human being…like most of us, no?He had a terrible, terrible life that was and is a circus. He did not choose that lifestyle, it was forced on him. He did not choose to be born, much less into that family. He has all the right in the world to get out of it, and tell this story.I was unloved and I felt it, I know what it feels like to be misunderstood but worst of all for your family not to care enough about you to understand you. To have no one to share, or if you shared or opened up there would be emotional consequences. And I think no one that has not distinctly gone through that can understand the pain (and confusion) it causes.Harry had all the material stuff in the world. Yes, he had the best life, education, everything money could buy. But he had a broken home life, a depressed and sometimes suicidal mother, a virtually emotionally absent father, and a completely ridiculous extended family. Plus, a media circus that was out there waiting for him to mess up. All the time. 24/7. How can anyone say that’s not a big deal…I hope this book brings him closure. I hope he moves on with his life and becomes a better father to his children than his father was to him. And I hope he becomes the person he wanted, the opposite of the naughty child the press wanted him to be. But this was a necessary telling of his story, if someone with as much privilege as Royal has such a heartbreakingly cold and sad upbringing, can we keep calling it privilege? He has no right to complain just because he was born into a family with a lot, a lot of money? That’s sad."
Bryan Tagas,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not At All What the Press Claims,"The press, particularly the British but also including some American outlets, have been harsh in their reviews of Spare for reasons having less to do with the quality of the book than with their own perceived ideas about what is appropriate in a memoir by a royal.  Many reviewers deal with such tangential issues as whether Harry's stated desire for reconciliation with his royal family will be hurt by his revelations.  This is not a valid reason to lambast the book.  The fact is that this is a raw, tell-it-from-the heart account of Harry's life in the royal family and what drove him to decide to leave it after his marriage to Meghan.  In that he succeeds brilliantly, with the help of course of his excellent ghost writer.  The collaboration produces an eloquent and damning portrait of the royal family and the complicit press.  You can't come away from reading this book without acknowledging that Harry's move to California was a necessary outcome.  Royalists, haters of the ""woke"" and traditionalists excoriate him for what he says.  But the inaccuracies in the book that they cite to undermine its credibility (such as where he was when he learned the Queen Mother had died) are really just pathetic.  The mistakes are incidental to an extraordinary story.  This is not a book for the close minded but is an excellent read for anyone wanting to know what really happened.  Harry finally got to tell his story and he did it well!"
Jessy,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry made me miss Princess Diana even more now.,"I love the way Prince Harry opened up about his life & relationships. He came across exactly like his mother, Princess Diana. He also shares how alike Duchess Meghan is like his mother. I know now why he had to take such drastic measures to keep his family safe and alive. I know now that if Meghan had stayed in England any longer they would have never had Princess Lily and Prince Archie may have lost his mother. I’m glad he shined a light on how selfish his brother is. Prince William has no empathy, it’s heartbreaking how he treated Harry especially just after they lost their beloved mother. Not to talk to him at school, what kind of person does that to his younger sibling after the death of a parent? I hope Prince William never becomes King. He doesn’t deserve it, neither does Charles but life isn’t fair. Prince Charles isn’t a real father, he didn’t even hug Harry after Princess Diana’s death. We definitely needed to hear his side & now we have. This book was so sad at times & anyone with a heart will cry while reading it. I am so glad that he & his family are in California leading a wonderful sunny life. I hope he can move on & enjoy his life in the California sunshine & take a break from family scrabbles, books & British gossip tabloids. Praying for the Sussexes."
Kathy Rice,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Grief, Love of Family, Trauma, PTSD, Missed Opportunities, Finding Your Own Path","Honest, raw, and emotional, laced with a sense of humor and grace. Critics have said Harry has thrown the BRF under the bus; I disagree. He's real, not boastful and holds himself accountable. Without giving anything away, I felt all the emotions. One of the best books I've read in the last 10 years.It's interesting that people want to slam Harry for his memoir, but say nothing of the other royals who have done the same. Charles did it and spoke negatively about his parents and upbringing. Diana did it and the notorious interview. And years later, what struck me that instead of hearing the pain she was in, her own son blames paranoia as her reason for agreeing to it. Sad!On another note, the British tabloids have been raking in the money and lining their pockets for years by taking things out of context and telling blatant lies to the point of harm & death threats. But Harry gets vilified for telling HIS truth and earning a living while he's at it? Weird!It's also interesting that Meghan gets blamed by so many, like she's the one who decided that their family's lives, mental health, and safety is what's most important. The nerve!Having read the book; context is everything. It didn't reveal anything devastating about other family members. He gives insight to certain instances while seemingly understanding or defending the reasoning at the same time. He also holds himself accountable throughout. He points out discrepancies and lies that were reported relentlessly by the press for years.He clearly loves his family and life of service. He has issues to what seems to be the operational and outside the immediate family aspects of it all. What he reveals doesn't leave me feeling he's doing this out of jealousy or revenge; it seems more about change and better addressing trauma and mental health in the future. And, definitely taking the air out of the tires of the trashy tabloids. Put it this way; I didn't come away thinking any less of other members of the BRF.Hopefully, in the coming years, the family will realize Harry's true intentions, and some good can come of it and they will all be better off for it.All the happiness to Prince Harry, Meghan and their beautiful children."
Beachlover,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible and captivating,"I first ordered the hardcover version but then thought to myself what it would mean to hear the story in his own voice so I also ordered the audiobook. I found listening to his voice, which is eloquent and soothing, an enjoyable way to hear this story. This is a story of love, grief, and in many ways, tragedy. But it does come full circle back to love.  This is a man who suffered unimaginable loss and grief in his childhood, from losing his beloved mother at a young age, which took his entire life to come to grips with, and even believe to be true. Searching for his purpose, perhaps not one that he was born into, but one that he chooses for himself.  Then he found the love of his life, his soulmate, one that he felt comfortable with, and, more importantly, made him happy, which so many found inconceivably necessary to judge and villify. His lifelong battle with the press from chasing his mother constantly to that very end in the tunnel, the constant lies told about him and his family, and now, attacking his beloved wife.  In the end, he stands as a loving husband and father.  No matter what anybody believes, that can never be taken from him. Nor will the spirit of his mother ever be taken from him.  Bravo Harry!"
KimberlyA.,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Mixed Bag…..No One Wins Here…,"I had to take a break from writing this review to separate my two sons. It seems one has pushed the other over in some sort of disagreement…Such is the nature of brothers, of siblings, of families.Prince Harry’s memoir is equal parts refreshingly and cringe-worthily honest. It leaves no stone unturned, and in that lies its greatness and its tragedy.Like any family, Prince Harry’s is a mix of differing personalities and quirks, but unlike every family they are a part of a 1000 year institution- in which the expectations, customs, and formality run deep. In fact he is in a position so unlike any other human that this is almost a must-read. But it’s more of a curiosity satisfier- and when you’re done you kind of get the feeling you do when you accidentally open a restroom stall and someone is using it.  You politely want to apologize excuse yourself from their business…What I liked- the Prince’s detailed account in falling in love with Meghan Markle. Marrying into a family culturally different than you is no easy feat- and I can’t imagine the learning curve she had to face- mostly alone. Her feelings of isolation and despair come across clearly. This is a man who truly loves his wife. Perhaps, as the late, remarkable Queen purportedly stated, maybe a little ‘over in love.’I also truly felt the Prince captured the pain of losing his beloved mother, in the most tragic of circumstances, poignantly and honestly. In that he does a service to those also suffering grief (i.e.-all of us). His openness and willingness to receiving mental health services is admirable and I believe will help many. (If only all were able to access the kinds of treatment and mental health support the Prince did, but I digress…)What I didn’t like:There is sharing and then there is over-sharing. (Hence, me feeling like I accidentally walked in on him in the restroom, indisposed). I don’t need/want to know the details of his ‘first time,’ while his military service is laudable, discussing the number of Taliban fighters he killed was in poor taste, and the tiny snippets he throws in regarding Kate seem rather petty.As a woman who admires both Kate and Meghan, I felt he was perhaps unintentionally adding to the common trope that women must always be jealous and fighting.Much of his disdain is aimed at the British press, and I can’t deny it is likely a brutal and ugly business. But perhaps too much disdain is aimed at his family as well- imperfect as they are.While I’m certain there was a level of catharsis in writing this memoir, I worry that the long term consequences will far outweigh any positive outcomes from such a blistering account. My prayers to this entire family as they navigate these tough waters, that have now seemingly become even more treacherous."
T. Thompson,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very believable account of Harry’s life between his mothers death & stepping down from Royal life.,"I found Spare to be a quite believable account of his life from Harry’s pov.  Remembering how the UK media treated his mother, with or without help from the Monarchy, they certainly never stood up for her even knowing how it could affect her sons.  I find their treatment of him through the years as well as Meghan very believable.  Harry cuts no slack in the recounting of events, even his own mistakes and bad behavior.  Finding his path in life via military service, even though the media almost caused him to not be able to serve, Harry grew up.  Meeting Meg, therapy and the final realization that when given the choice between their own popularity and standing up for their son/brother his family had no problem with throwing the “Spare” under the preverbal bus.Number 1 rule, you can not outshine the Monarch/Heir, Diana and Megan did both.  Two things that surprised me in this book, Charles while absolutely out of his depth as a single parent does love both his sons.  William has from a young age definitely considered his brother less than, and I think in the last few years (probably around the time he seemed serious about Meghan) that Harry should bow to his wishes, even to the point of sacrificing his own happiness.Spare is definitely worth the read."
Serena,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Diana would be so proud,I've always had a thing for gingers LOL and I'll never forget harry walking behind his mother's coffin never that image stuck in my mind and my heart as it did Many people. I am so impressed Buy his honesty He does not at all Put his family down I don't doubt anything he says And it's extremely obvious to me that the people that made the biggest impression on him in his life where his mother and grandmother Hearing someone be so raw and candid Is refreshing and beautiful and all I can say is Megan and harry are too very lucky people to have each other and the great love that they have. I Honestly believe after hearing the love and adoration these people have for each other that people are jealous playing in simple of something they just cannot comprehend or understand which is sad to me. His devotion to his family his wife his children is extremely attractive and mind blowing blowing and God bless his heart Harry we stand behind you Here in America And we admire your loyalty to your family. Like I said your mother would be so proud of you and I'm sure she is So happy for you that you  finally found what you have deserved all  along Which is just love  family loyalty and devotion
Paige Devereaux,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An account of his account of survival through the same sick gauntlet that took his mother.,"Beautifully written, this is the story of a boy that was born into a family that couldn't meet him in the depths of his loss, his heart, or his authenticity as he struggled a lifetime with undiagnosed PTSD since the tragic loss of his mother. His journey is one of trauma, betrayal, abandonment, as he struggled to keep moving ahead to find his way. You will smile as you read about the authentic friends sprinkled along the way, you will cheer when he rises to the challenge, and hopefully have compassion when he falls short, as we all have. It has an incredible ending where true love and twin souls find one another like needles in the haystack. This memoir is one that proves, when you keep standing and keep fighting, light wins, no matter what the evil media does, no matter the hidden agenda of his father and his wife do to turn the spotlight from their own bad press, no matter what jealousy and sibling rivalry does to destroy your own brother. His resume speaks for himself, and if he was ever a ""spare,"" it was to be waiting in the wings to finish the sincerity his mother shared with the world, when she was no longer here. I haven't purchased a hardcover book in a decade, and I read this cover to cover. It was excellent."
wildjoy,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A life thoughtfully examined,"I’ve always admired the Royal Family, and I looked forward to reading what Prince Harry had to say. This book was well written, expressive of so much life experience, and gave a view from a wholly different perspective than most of us can imagine having. I’ve read lots of criticism of Prince Harry for daring to write and publish his own thoughts about his own life. Here’s my thoughts on that: many, many people have been making obscene fortunes writing about him since the day he was born. Why is it so offensive for him to write about himself?! And he has so much to say, about grief, about family, about PTSD, about service. He does it well. If you’re looking for a gossipy tell all, go find a scandal sheet at your nearest convenience store. But if you want to hear a young man describe his growing into the man he is, and reflect on all the powerful array of forces and societal expectations he’s had to navigate (and this book covers far more than his marriage - I was two thirds through it before he mentions meeting Meghan), this is a book that will make you think, make you re-examine your assumptions, and make you realize that under all the trappings of royalty and service and family intrigue we are all human beings just… being human."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written, keep an open mind","Overall well written; however, I am no critic.  I had trouble putting the book down.  Those that trash the book I believe lack ability to grasp the situation.  Has Harry acted out at times, yes.  While that may annoy some readers one must understand this is a person that has grown up lacking exposure to situations that allow them to develop adult skills.  He was not allowed to have a 9-5 job, his own checking account that he needs to manage, etc.  He was managed by others in many respects.  Therefore, we cannot expect him to have the same level of auditing skills as the rest of us.  Others will point that he is privileged and has no right to complain.  However, he was also somewhat a prisoner.  Would someone rather have access to finances or freedom to decide what to wear to your wedding, who to marry, to be able to walk down the street without being mobbed by the public, not because you asked to but just for being born.  I don’t see him as privileged, until now, because now he has the same freedoms we do.  I would never want that life, doesn’t seemed privileged to me.  I make my own decisions and can go shopping and can have a job with a checking account."
V.Kaye,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeds expectations!!,"I'm not quite finished with the book. I purchased both the Kindle and the Audible versions so I can switch back and forth. So far, I'm finding this to be an incredible read! Harry really lays open his soul and life's journey, vulnerable and exposed, so we can read and dissect it.  Many have pointed to the more salacious parts of the book and have wondered why Harry would  add them to his memoir. I get it though. Why share your truth if you can’t be completely honest with yourself and others? Harry talks openly about therapy; he's used to this kind of disclosure by now. It's hard work: so painful and raw to discuss trauma, grief, loss, and isolation. It's also very brave! I for one, am very grateful that Harry has shared his journey with us.  The Audible version is great fun for the portion of the narrative that's funny and light. Harry is such an animated and engaging narrator, too!  I found that 3-4 hours went by in a snap! But there were certain parts in the narrative where I had to switch from Audible to Kindle. I felt profound sadness, was struck by what was being said, and had to sit in silence for a bit and take in the moment. A good book can and should do that for the reader. I found myself, incredulous and heartbroken reflecting on how Harry was told that his mother had died, and on the moments and hours that followed. In another passage, detailing the aftermath of the infamous Nazi incident and Harry's meeting with the Chief Rabbi of Britain, the Rabbi's sage message to him left me thinking about accountability, grace, forgiveness, and healing.  I can go on, there's so many thought provoking passages to list. Harry has taken us on his incredible journey of grief, anger, pain, loss, service, love, grace and complicated family dynamics from childhood to présent day. In the process of reading it and digesting it, I've learned a lot about myself as well. These themes are universal, after all.  Thank you, Harry! I wish you and your family comfort and happiness along your future path!"
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,There are ALWAYS two sides to every story...,"Its extremely interesting to me that reviews by Americans seem to be positive, and reviews from the British I've seen are much more generally negative. It would seem that the British press has been very successful in convincing their audience with their garbage...and they're continuing with the same garbage when critiquing this  book...Before reading this book, I was able to see for myself the bias the British press had when ""reporting"", (fabricating would be more accurate), stories about Harry and Meghan...Kate eating avocados was fine, but Meghan eating them was somehow not, etc...I didn't need this book to realize H & M were being unfairly targeted and demonized by them, but this book definitely spells out just how incredibly dishonest, despicable and rabid these  ""journalists "" are.  And shame on the rest of the royal family for not stepping up and protecting and defending their own. I imagine their behavior wouldn't surprise Prince Harry's mother in the least...This was a great read, hard to put down, thoughtfully written, painfully honest and disturbing. I  highly admire Prince Harry for writing this book and getting his side of the story out there, and like he has said, these are HIS words, NOT the media's, not some obscure ""sources""...too bad the rest of the Royal family doesn't have half the guts he has..."
Kg Spaz,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,in his own words,"Very impressed with how genuinely honest, insight and down to earth Prince Harry is.  As I was reading I was also struck my how truly shallow and self centered his father and brother are; how caught up they are with the importance of being thought of as better, and more powerful—trying to wield their royal position over Harry as if it truly meant they were his masters and he their slave.My immediate thought upon hearing William calls Harry “Harold” was he felt disdain for his younger brother.  Condescending really.  What I read from then on seamed to confirm it.  I truly hope I’m wrong…Sadly it’s their — and Britain’s — loss they devalued Harry and  his delightfully open and loving wife Megan! For is father, the now King Charles, to suddenly cut off his son and family’s security guards while they were under attack and receiving death threats showed he truly held no true love for his son! Ditto for his brother. They both are the rulers, yet they both lack fellow fellow and backbone.  Both of which Harry has an abundance.It’s heartbreaking the way Harry and Megan were, and still are, treated by the press, and his own Father and brother.Yet, I applaud Harry for finally finding a good therapist that helped him get to know and work through the “whys,” and become the good and loving husband and father he is today.Thank you Harry, for telling us your truths, sharing your life and allowing us to share delight over finally finding “The One!”"

This was overall outstanding - I listened to the audio version while following along with the physical book version and felt that to be the best way to take in everything he shared, especially being able to hear tones to words, sentences, etc.It was vulnerable, honest, accountable, sad, heartbreaking, joyful, loving, eye-opening, etc. My eyes are even more open, clearer. I'm so happy for H & M finding each other, for Harry finding himself, and his path to healing and his own love, happiness, and peace that he and his family have worked tirelessly to build and protect. My respect knows no bounds to the Sussex family and their incredible support system. Wow. Everyone should read this and actively listen to what all he shares. There's a lot to learn, a lot to make you pause, think, feel, and a lot to recognize in creating change for the greater good of humanity as a whole on a myriad of levels.As for the late Princess Diana, The People's Princess, she is a guardian angel... her legacy, character, heart, kindness all carry on through the Sussex family. Prince Harry, The People's Prince, safe to say... thank you for sharing your story, your truth, your hurt, your heart, you. Keep fighting the good fight, H & M!"
Doug Kierulff,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Touching, deep, tragic and heartwarming","It’s hard to articulate just all the emotions and feelings this book evokes. If you consider Prince Harry and Meghan who they actually are, and not what the paparazzi and media make them out to be, at their heart they are genuine, authentic and honest people reflecting back to us, the readers, their simple humanity in the midst of very unique, challenging and difficult circumstances.Whether we are raised poor, wealthy, middle class, we all share common struggles.  At the end of the day, Prince Harry demonstrates, through his own words, that he is just like anyone else, and even more so like all of us.In his book, Prince Harry courageously rebels against and deflects the Truman Show that he was raised in out of love for his wife and children (and his own deserving of dignity and self respect.).What is tragic is the relationship between him and his brother, Prince William, and that the future king is forever stuck in his guilded cage. It’s crushing to see the reality of his imprisonment through Prince Harry’s eyes.Thank goodness Prince H is taking this opportunity to spread his wings and fly. More power to him, and I look forward to seeing how he and Meghan utilize this new platform of TRUTH they both have created."

To go thru soo much, hurt, despair, anguish, turmoil, and disgusting reports and criticism from people,  reporter's,  some family, staff you've had in all your life, that backstab you for the monetary gain,  is unfathomable!!!! Shame on them! Take a look at yourself,  before you critique anyone else, let alone someone you've never met! And get your damn facts straight and backed up legitimately before you print a damn story, or tell a story.  His book,  his and his wife's words,  his views as he saw it and received it.  You,  the outsiders weren't there.  So we have no business degrading Harry or Meghan for lies being told of them.  It's very sad how people think about other people, and voice it out loud, not caring how it can take a toll on them mentally.  I have lived and loved the day your mother, princess Diana came to be apart of the monarchy.  I have watched you and your brother grow up.

Kivulini,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bravo Harry!,"Despite all the leaks and indignant positioning by Daily Hate among other tabloid scum that tried to divert attention away from his thoughts, Harry has written and narrated an extraordinary book that explains who he is and what he had to do to save his life and the security of his family.I found his account of his time in the army and in Afghanistan surprisingly engaging and well written. His own personal account about his struggles and the choices and decisions he made, made it more apparent the fervor and urgency to what the tabloids have aggressively tried to contest because they are trying to also advocate their relevance. The terrible marriage the family were forced into making with the Royal corp to exist had some significant and lasting effects on one, particularly someone clearly struggling with mental health and you can’t help but hope other struggling family members find the courage to speak their truths and heal their souls.I recommend this book so that you may draw your own conclusions with the perspective from his and Meg’s side that they strongly needed to share, and not from the opportunists. If you don’t agree, that’s your truth but well done for having viewed it from his perspective and not what you were told to perceive."

Read it.,"I wasn’t sure whether to buy this book because I thought I had seen and heard enough through media and Harry/Meghan’s interviews. I always found the couple intriguing,  it’s no wonder the media hounded at them. I am glad I bought the book. It’s given me further insight into their reasons for leaving. Harry’s life experiences are not normal in terms of privilege, wealth, and media interest and he shares them all as if he was talking to a long time trusted friend. After reading the book, I feel differently about his father, the king. I didn’t think much of him as a father before, but Harry redeemed him in this book in spite of his failures to support him most recently with the media and their exit. In sharing about his life, he gives insight into what role/benefit the royal family plays/could play in the scheme of things. I think they may have some relevance if they modernize and it’s run well and not as a tabloid resource empire. I hope his family reads it, it’s in their benefit to. I also hope there is reconciliation in the near future for all of them. If you are on the fence about reading it, I strongly recommend to read it. There are a lot of insights that the media does not portray correctly."

Marcia Keeth,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Inspiring Read,"Prince Harry courageously and candidly tells his own story in his own words with humility and humor. Throughout the book, he reveals how the press abuse the British royal family, how they are treated as commodities, and how Buckingham Palace willingly participates and even encourages this behavior. I came away with enormous empathy for the Prince and all of his family whose lives are so limited by this unhealthy relationship between palace and press. Interestingly, he never blames the public and the people’s thirst for royal family coverage. Instead he focuses on the media's distortions, invasions of privacy, and indifference to the dangers they create and the pain they cause. Throughout this book I got to know a kind and caring young man who was never allowed to — or shown how to — grieve for the loss of his mother at a very young age; who lived in the shadow of his older brother and father; and who never knew a loving and supportive family life — until now. Prince Harry saved himself and found joy, love, and happiness. When his choices put him at odds with one of the world's most powerful institutions, he had the courage to take control of his story, demonstrating enormous character and humanity. Bravo, Harry!  This book is a great read."

It is a good read with lots to relate to and experience healing from sufferings.Spare is a real story with  a personal insight, revelation, self examination, humour, loss and grief, dysfunctions and disconnections in relationships, love and romance, etc.I can relate to Harry's honesty and the raw narrative of his loss and grieve. While I was 13years old,  I watched  Harry and his brother walked behind their mother's casket, a woman deeply loved by many of us around the world. We wondered what the two boys were feeling and thinking in that moment of loss. We wept for the Princess of Wales, Princess  Diana for weeks. We prayed for the wellbeing of her two boys, she left in this wicked world.Harry's book, Spare is an answered prayer to many of us. The youngest of Diana's boys, Prince Harry is talking to us through the book. He is speaking directly to us in his own words, how his life was and has been since his mother died.  I loss my mother in 2020. I can relate to Harry's story. It has helped me in  processing my loss and grief. It's a must read. I strongly recommend Spare to anyone struggling with loss and grief, abandonment issues, dysfunctional and disconnection in relationships, rejection, discrimination, and more.Thank you Prince Harry for this wonderful and excellent masterpiece."
madelaine,Reviewed in Germany on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,not as expected but in a positive way,"I am currently reading this book and im finding it hard to put down, despite some reviews to the contrary, i find it to be very well written and appears to be honestly written from Prince Harrys own perspective and memory, this gives the picture so far as i have read of a young boy who has never recovered from the trauma of losing his mother and not being allowed to grieve as a normal young boy, but having to follow royal protocol of the ""stiff upper lip"", the pain of which has shaped his whole life thus far....i find it a fascinating read and though always a fan of Harrys it has made me like him even more, hes simply very human and expresses his emotions openly  without embarrasment, something Royals are not able or taught to do."
JayNBet,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Enlightening, Dark and Brutally Honest","The key to changing the status quo, the trajectory of your life is being able to speak to the truth of your own weaknesses, fears and faults. This book takes us on Harry's journey and why shouldn't he be the one to tell his story? For his entire life, the British tabloids have made millions on lies. For several decades now, the Monarchy has trotted themselves out before the so-called press and remained utterly silent when lies were told. This isn't just about Harry and Meghan. The press has feasted on the lives of Charles, Camilla, Diana, Harry and William as the Establishment hung them out there in some sadistic attempt to stay relevant and keep the eye of the press off other discretions. This book just puts it out there in black and white.Whatever respect I had for the Royal family ended with the death of the Queen. Even she remained silent throughout the years. The world lost their minds when the Royals remained silent when Diana was killed. Those people who wept for her and the treatment of her by the press, now point fingers at Harry and Meghan. Society chooses to believe tabloids rather than the actual person. This book is a sad testament to the state of society.In the end, Harry is the one standing up for his family. The one he created with Meghan and their children. In the meantime, William and Charles continue to dance to the organ grinder's tune. Why? Fear. They fear not being view as valuable to the Commonwealth. They fear change.I applaud Harry for being his own man."
Yael Bolender,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Touching & Honest Book I Have Ever Read,"I am amazed by the quality and the cleverness of this book. It is touching, honest, sad, funny, extremely well written and also very interesting about foreign countries and exotic animals, about the war techniques, not what I was expecting at all, but I never got bored and it educated me. Not a lot of gossip, always classy. It made me cry a lot and also laugh a lot.Please, don’t listen to what the media say, it all makes sense once you read the book and there is nothing awful, contrarily to what is said in the tabloids. Actually, I feel very sorry for the whole royal family, they are all victims it seems, but Harry had the cleverness to leave. Meghan or no Meghan, he would have left at a point anyway. Reading this book is like watching a more intellectual episode of 24, Harry is running and escaping ennemis all the time, it is very scary sometimes. Some images may be too shocking for sensitive people, especially regarding the war or hurt animals. But the whole thing is worth reading. I highly, I highly recommend this book. How not adore this young man and wife + children + dogs after reading this?"
T,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is what freedom looks like,"Finally being able to tell his story. Not secretly through tapes like his mom. Not coerced through journals like his dad. the Duke of Sussex, Harry, let's go of everyone's expectations and rules and tells his story, his way, without anyone telling him how. So much of his life wss following the rules , even if the rules were unfair and led to his death. Finally free of the bonds of royal expectations, he leads his own way and path. What's even more satisfying is knowing Harry is finally the one making money off his own story, instead of everyone else. How was the Prince living in a doll house shack, while the tabloid workers, lived in mansions?I know his title Spare is in reference to him being the second born, but for me its like he's finally saying, ""Spare me your lies, I'm done with the system.  Harry has shown how vitally important it is to tell our own stories. Whether anyone listens or believes isn't the point. Whether we sell millions of copies or not also isn't the point. The point is as Harry said, "" to speak the truth from my own mouth."" Thanks for the Mic drop Harry!Well done and I'm going to even purchase the hard copy.Highly recommend to others!"
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting, sad and revealing","Prince Harry was right when he said most people remember where they were when they first heard about his mother's accident.The most important thing to know is that the UK tabloids are rotten and spread false narratives because they sell papers.  The worst papers are owned by Rupert Murdock who lost a lawsuit about wiretapping and printing false information.  Murdock dumbed down his UK papers to reach lower and middle-class readers who likely believe everything they read.The institution is to blame for not supporting Harry and for leaking things to the press.  The courtiers kept Harry's pleas from Queen Elizabeth.  The then Prince Charles and his wife leaked information to the press to elevate public opinion of themselves and to lower that of  Prince Harry and Megan.  Charles  was jealous of them, the same as he was jealous of Princess Diana who received favorable press.Prince Harry wrote the book to have his say because of all the false UK narratives that caused death threats.  He was also a prime target when he served his country in the military.  He had no choice but to leave the UK.  To protect his family he does not share full-face pictures of his children which is so sad.The part about his military life was very fascinating.  It is such a shame he was stripped of his military patronages.The part about being knocked out by Prince William should have been left out of the book.  It did show that his brother, groomed at an early age to be the heir, expected the Spare to do as he was told. The same can be said of his father, who called the shots and held the purse strings.Readers in the US can form their own opinions.  Mine is Harry was treated poorly and lost his country and his family's financial support for security.  The institution treats him like a child and not the adult he is."
Kim H,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic and heartfelt,"I greatly appreciated this remarkably resilient and candid young man sharing so much of his personal journey.  I have two sons of the same age as he and his brother; my youngest a fellow ginger. The royals are, and always will be, an enigma to me, but I’m grateful for a better understanding of how difficult and restrictive their lives must be.  I mostly ignore anything the tabloid press has to say, particularly the British tabloids, as they've always seemed so laser focused on tattling on the BRF for one overblown sin or another.  Most of the referenced headlines were new to me. Not to mention utterly shocking, and positively dripping with rabid hate and contempt for the people whose very existence puts food on their tables.  I can only say that I think H&M seem to have made the right, and ultimately healthiest, choices for themselves and their family. You only get one shot at life, and I think it’s a crime to waste a minute of it living in misery out of a sense of duty.  Suffering is not your duty, and it's not a crime to seek out and live your best life.  Sorry you have to give up those you love, the very ones who should understand and sympathize the most, but it's up to them to make their own choices and live with the consequences."
jmom,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Truth,"If everyone who trashed Harry based on the sensationalized incomplete excerpts from the book leaked by the media, would actually READ it, they may come away with a different perspective.I don’t want give away any spoilers, so I won’t get into specifics. However, in every instance of a media excerpt, only part of the incident was revealed. The part that manipulated the public into thinking in terms of only heroes and villains. Team Harry or Team William. Team Kate or Team Meghan. Everyones’ relationships were far more complicated. The press conveniently left out the part that William apologized to Harry after knocking him down. No, they didn’t escape that incident reconciled, but Harry did write that William apologized.The real villains in this story are the Press and the Institution of an anachronistic Monarchy stuck in traditions more than 1000 years old.The Press that got away with stalking, hounding, chasing, and traumatizing a young boy who was psychologically damaged by his mother’s death and never got the support from his family that he needed. He never began to heal until he went into therapy in his 30’s.A “family” that is so insulated and isolated that they, including the late Queen, were manipulated by a Palace staff that lies, controls what the royals hear and see, and controls the family’s access to each other.So try read the book for yourself before you pass judgement. You may still come away against Team Harry, but at least your opinion will be based on material you actually read for yourself."
susan,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Writing,"This book was well-written, a quick read, and an enlightened view into the life of royal.  Prince Harry really didn't disparage anyone but just told his story from his perspective.  Witty, poignant, and sad at times - this memoir was exactly that, his memories of events as he saw them.  Nothing was really off-limits, Harry sharing intimate details as a part of the narrative of his life and the shackles imposed on being born royal coupled with the symbiotic relationship with press.  I can't imagine how his life has been after losing his mother at the age of 12, the one solid relationship he had until her death, and being forced to navigate dealing with the paparazzi and press that literally murdered his mum and multiple relationships. It's interesting to me that the same people who cut him off from funding are criticizing him from profiting from sharing his story.  He really was in a no-win predicament -  stay in England and accept continued emotional harm and threats to his family or move away and be slandered for doing so.  Maybe it's not The Monarchy that is the issue but the institution behind it.  Whatever the cause, the book just made me want to give Harry a big hug and say to him bravo for standing your ground and setting the record straight."
Vascomar,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent.,"As a young mother, going through some difficult times, I remember telling myself  ""Get real: NO body  has a perfect life: even the Queen has problems!"" I find it reassuring that dysfunctional families are an almost universal phenomenon.I enjoyed this book, written from one man's perspective. Like so many others, I've read the almost hysterical negative coverage of the Duke and Success of Sussex in British publications for years. As a mother, I know that there are usually 2 sides to every story and the ""truth"" is usually somewhere in between.  In this case, I tend to give more credence to Prince Harry.This book has been picked apart by the British tabloids but, honestly, if I were to write about MY life, my family would quick to disagree with my memories. These are Prince Harry's memories, his life. I think he did a very good job. The book is readable and shows a man who , after his share of youthful stupidity, is trying to do his best to be a good human being, a good husband, and a good father. It was interesting even it was terribly sad in places."
EJ'sMommie,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Read,"First of all, I have never been a fan of Meghan and Harry as a couple and only purchased this book out of curiosity. Well, I have to say it is far from ""chaotic"" and ""entitled.""  It is one of the best books I have ever read. It's a page turner and I couldn't put it down. This is not as much because of its content as the writing. Harry has writing talent as this well-written work shows. I was most impressed by how he describes being unable to process his mother's death. When a person experiences trauma, the brain will compartmentalize and repress the traumatic memory. It's not that the person doesn't remember the trauma, but it is impossible to fully access and deal with the trauma. I think this is because by its very nature (trauma) we are unable to deal with it. I know because this happened to me.  Being famous and in the press all the time has exacerbated this situation for Harry.  It is obvious that he loves his father and his brother and I am left with the hope that they can be a family again."
Stitch,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,I’m a Republican so I’ll be honest I went into reading this listening to all the negative hype conservatives were saying about the book. Somewhere down the line everything became us vs them and for a few hours I just wanted to hear their side. I loved Suits but then Megan hated Trump and that upset me and I really don’t believe in Global warming. I do believe we should take care of our planet it’s all we have. This book is brilliantly written. I don’t find it self indulgent at all. Harry is just a man telling a story in his own words and I loved every second of it. Some people say it’s written like a fiction book but that’s what made me love it. Usually in a biography I’m bored by page 50. I was hooked by page 2 and never looked back.*Well done Harry. Keep fighting for your family. I know you miss your home but home is where you feel safe and the UK just wasn’t that anymore. When you get settled one day you need to build a pub on your land like Ed Sheeran did. Then you won’t feel so far away. Also lots of beautiful land like Scotland in the USA. Think Appalachian mountains.* Great book. You won’t be disappointed.
Rae Ann McCardell,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry in his own words,"No matter what you think of him, this is Prince Harry's story in his own words.From a little boy who knew very clearly that he was not as important as his brother, was shoved Into an unwanted public life and then lost his mother just as publicly.What would Prince Harry's life had been if his mother had been able to remain in his life a guide him? We can only guess. But one thing that is clearly evident that as much as his family may love him what was public was far more important that how he was doing in private at all points of his life.There is a clear and established hierarchy in royalty and I have no problem believing that ""the spare"" and eventually his wife were intentionally given the scrape goat status so that his father and brother looked better.  No-one will ever know how much of that was known by King Charles and Prince William.Congratulations to the Duke and Ditches for forging their own way outside the palace. Even more so to Prince Harry for being able to find a direction and path in a life, something it is clear that most of the time he was without."
Brenden Dodd,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and vulnerable - brave and personal.,"If you've ever dealt with a dysfunctional family, hurt from childhood loss, or struggled to discover your passion and purpose, you will find this a gripping and yet strangely relatable read. Royalty comes with privilege, but also with restrictions, protocols, and at times not surprisingly - notable barriers to emotional healing and wellness.I couldn't put this book down. Read it over a weekend in between work shifts. Prince Harry details in great vulnerability the events and people that have impacted his life. It is thoughtful. Insightful. At times I laughed and at other times I wanted to cry. His whole life story up to this point is a solid reminder to walk a day in someone else's shoes before you assume you know what they're going through. Royalty doesn't get a free pass from family dysfunction and gaslighting. But it does make it strangely more difficult to escape it.I grew up in the USA in the 90s as a child and watched Princess Diana's funeral with my mom as a 7-year-old girl. The British news and tabloids would later convey to my teenage self that Prince Harry was a wild member of the royal family who loved a good time and at times bordered on rebellion. In his book, Spare, Prince Harry pulls back the curtain on his childhood and adolescence and his journey to healing with incredible detail. Its the story I didn't get in the 1990's and early 2000's.After reading this book, I did decide that Prince Harry would make an excellent American. He's not afraid to move across the ocean to find new freedoms and to protect his family. He has a heart for justice. He questions the way things are in search of a better future. When he asks ""why"" he doesn't accept the answer ""because this is the way things have always been."" This book shows the pushback he faced as a result while weaving a bittersweet coming-of-age story."
Jacqueline Jean-Francois,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Riveting, well written, eye opener","This book is so well written that you feel included in every chapter of his journey. I laugh, I cry, and the book forces you to ask the question. If it was any other institution than the monarchy, would they have gotten away with the way he was mistreated?  The way Harry and his wife were abused?For so many books written about Harry’s life, I am ecstatic that he gets to put his account of the events in a memoir. There are two sides to the story—the RF and their incestuous partner's side, which have been at the forefront since Harry’s mother died, and Harry’s who had to live the atrocities account.This memoir is a legacy for Archie and Lili, a way to know that, above all else, their pa chose to protect them and their mom. And by doing so, he was crucified, but Gladly accepted the consequences because His nuclear family was more than worth it. Bravo, Harry, WHAT A KING! WHAT A MAN! WHAT A HUSBAND! WHAT A FATHER!

The tweets the statements the photos the weddings. All of it... Never could I have imagined this book.It has been such a long time since I read a new book that hit me this deeply. While all reading is subjective, I feel confident in saying this was one of the most beautifully written pieces I have ever gotten to read. From page one I was in rapture.Harry's story, the one we all know so well, is so deeply rooted in the human experience. Love, grief, triumph, setbacks.What makes it incredible is not just seeing how a royal, a prince, spent his life fighting the same battles as we do, but hearing him tell this story without any connotation of special circumstances. Harry, the boy who wanted to live an average life of family friends and a little fun along the way. Harry, the man who wanted nothing more than to help people, be truthful to people, to do the work and go home. Just Harry.Through it all, and after everything, this book feels like another way of trying to reach people. With love, with understanding, with camaraderie and solidarity. For a man and a family) that's been through so much there's healing and connection on every page.I have so many words, I have no words.

D.N.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Poignant, Relatable, Inspiring, Heartbreaking, Beautiful","Spare is simply beautiful. I didn't expect to cry at the end, but the journey on which this book takes the reader, is extraordinarily moving. I have followed Harry's story the last several years since abuse of Harry and Meghan by the British press escalated. As an abuse survivor myself, what Harry shares here harkens back to the years of abuse from my family of origin. To read Harry's story going from a ""spare"" child who was absolutely neglected and abused, to a man who has found love and freedom, is nothing short of inspiring. Harry is incredibly intelligent, thoughtful, introspective, empathetic, humble, observant, kind, and caring, and it comes through on every page. I purchased both the hardcover and audio version, and I highly recommend both. The words on the page are beautiful, and Harry's voice (and singing) are truly phenomenal. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Fellow survivors will find hope and healing in these pages, and those who have not endured trauma or abuse will come away looking at life through a new lens. Anyone who is unmoved or angered by this book, it is worth questioning their integrity, because this book is pure integrity, love, grace, hope, and healing."

Harry can't come up with any dates, says he can't remember the dates of anything , Said he was At college on a Hot summers day when the phone call came about his Great Great Grandmother passing , He was not at school he was Skiing in Switzerland with his Brother  ( I remember this) And the papers have come back with the proof. Harry says that his mother bought him an XBox for his 13th birthday in advance of her death that her sister brought to the school for him, again not true the XBox didn't come out till 4 years later . There is so many holes in the book . Every other page has something on it that didn't happen. He takes NO reasonability for ANYthing even when the evidence is staring him in his face.

Judy Plauche,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Loved this Book,"I just finished Prince Harry’s book, Spare.  Having both a hardcopy and listening to the story on Audible,  I definitely preferred listening to it on Audible, as Harry himself reading his story aloud￼ was nothing short of captivating.  He has a pleasing voice and I was able to live his life, vicariously, while I was lost in the book.  I literally flew through the chapters.  Super well written. Superbly read by Harry. Heartfelt. He told his truth. The last two chapters were most touching, as this is when he begins his journey of introspection.  Harry knows he has some catching up to do maturity-wise, and is gracious about it.  I would say the main feeling I had at the end of the book was that Harold Windsor has just had a HUGE awakening to the world around him.  It’s almost as if he’s just escaped a lifelong gilded cage cult.  But he HAS been awakened and I actually can’t wait to see what he does next.  I not only recommend this book, I cheer for ￼￼￼the victory of a new beginning"
mary,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Touching look at how trauma takes its toll on a young man.,This book was so much more than what I expected from all the pre-release hype.  Have to admit to being a Princess Diana fan and also experienced a life altering trauma in Sept 1997.  Harry's story I saw as a true story of how trauma and loss at a young age can alter who a person becomes.  Harry's trauma in losing his mother was never addressed because it would not be royal like to show emotion.  Who can blame him for having problems with paps and blaming them for is mother's death.  Who can blame him for wondering if she wasn't still alive out there somewhere.  I saw this book more of a life's journey to look for answers from within.  How amazing that he turned out to be the sensitive caring young man that he is.  Thank God he found someone like Megan to share his life with.  I am left so sad that his family could not accept him or his wishes.  I feel like all the press about this book have done it a mis-service.  To me it is more a search for mental health healing and survival against the odds.
Graham G Grant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Life in a death cult,"There are very few scenarios or memories that Harry can’t twist to his own rather cynical agenda. That’s principally a long-running, bitter vendetta against the ‘British Press’, and against the Royal Family - whom he brands a ‘death cult’. They’re complicit with the Press, sometimes - he alleges - using their friends in the papers to spread negative stories about Harry and Meghan. His other preoccupation, of course, is his bereavement, and Spare is really about the trauma of losing ‘Mummy’ (though the book ends with another bereavement, when the Queen - ‘Granny’ - dies). Diana’s death, which happened when Harry was 12, has cast a long shadow over his life. Yes, there were privileges. But Harry was also ‘infantilised’ - and later cut adrift, as he describes it, when he and Meghan decided they wanted to leave the U.K., and its loathed ‘paps’ - the furtive and not so furtive photographers who he says have made his life hell, and who he believes killed his Mummy. Harry wanted out, but didn’t want permanent exile - he was effectively sacked, or so he claims. Charles thinks journalists are the ‘scum of the earth’, Harry says. But the new King likes the positive PR generated by the Press, when it happens - to the extent that he puts up with the negative coverage. Charles seems bemused that Harry can’t do the same, or isn’t willing to. Towards the end - and the closing sections, on Megxit, are easily the most compelling - Harry says he might be able to forgive the Press - which I don’t buy. But he says he probably won’t be able to forgive his own family - the Royals - for colluding against him, using the Press as a conduit for their cowardly attacks (as he sees it). Or at least forgiveness will be much harder. Surely these relationships - with Willy and Pa, as he calls them - are shattered irrevocably. And Wills and Pa are highly unlikely ever to speak out to respond to these allegations… This is also a book about a deeply troubled man with a unique perspective on one of the world’s most dysfunctional families. He’s prey to all manner of cranks - mediums and therapists - but none of it seems to do him much good. It all gets a bit wearing. He’s unable to take responsibility for his own mistakes, always looking for someone else to blame - either the papers, or his dad, or Willy, or all of them. It’s a sad soap opera… But I raced through it - it’s highly readable, and well-written (by a ghostwriter). And there’s a hint of more revelations to come. I’d probably read a follow-up… but I have a feeling the barrel has been well and truly scraped. My verdict is that Harry needs to grow up and stop complaining. But then this book, rather like any sense of humility or perspective on Harry’s behalf, wouldn’t exist."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry,"I don't read books like this, and am not involved with social media. I can rarely tolerate watching the news any more. Fortunately I am retired & don't have to keep up with all current events for talk around the water cooler. I do, however, remember being glued to news channels when Princess Diana died. Over the years, I have heard some negative news about Prince Harry. I do read novels constantly & when this came up on Amazon & on sale I decided to learn what Prince Harry himself had to say & I'm glad I purchased the book. To those who believe he is lining his own pocket, you don't read very carefully. HE'S DONATING ALL PROCEEDS TO CHARITY! And to those who think he is whinning, I strongly disagree! Place yourself in his shoes. I believe he comes across quite humbly. It is also well written! He's British and uses British English. I believe the negative reviewers have been so strongly influenced by the media to give it a chance. While he has enjoyed more privileges in life than the masses, I cannot imagine surviving the difficulties placed in his path at nearly every turn. I hope his future is filled with peace and joy."
Astrologer Dawn,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant, beautiful and haunting","Growing up in England and now living in the USA I can understand the fascination of the Royals.  Harry's book is clear, concise with beautiful images painted about a continent he loves, Africa.  His war experience is just that and has probably made him the man he is today.  I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down until I finished it at 3am.  It's definitely a page turner.  Knowing and having lived with the British press, Harry got it spot on what they are like.  There's not as much about the Royals, expect some small spats that might seem silly to many of us, but then we haven't lived in a fishbowl.  I'm glad Meg and Harry are living in America where they have control over their narrative.  I always wondered if he would be the one to get out of the fishbowl and I'm glad he did. Starting with the death of his mother and ending with the death of the Queen this is one book I would have paid more to read.  Sad the British have been indoctrinated.  It's time the Royal Family was disbanded!  Good for Harry for creating his own income and his own life."
Jade Tiongson,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good read and well written.,"I've read quite a few autobiographies these past few months. This was really good. I read the Kindle version of this. I'll probably listen to it when it becomes available in the library. I'm in no rush.I think for the most part, what we watch, read, and hear from the media about Harry and Meghan have been blown out of proportion. If you are reading this for curiosity's sake, it's definitely worth looking into. If you are reading for the gossip, I think there's plenty to find out. I read it because I think everyone has the right to speak their truth.  His father Prince Charles had approved a biography years ago and that wasn't received all too well at the time of the war of the Wales'. I think time will tell how people will truly see the real effects of this book on the monarchy or the RF in general.The take away is, I think Harry did a good job talking about his mental health, his experience with media intrusion, and a toxic family dynamic because they simply can't be a real family. I think he wrote about his family in a truthful way. I didn't get the sense he was trashing anyone. He was sharing an insight on how he experienced and interpreted those moments. I felt his vulnerability and why he shared what he did. He seemed to accept his faults and flaws in the situations he was in. In a way it felt like he was trying to tell his story to his father and brother without being interrupted and they could take it or leave it. Almost like a plea to be heard.Even if he had a ghost writer help him write the narrative, a ghost writer is only as good as his source. I'm honestly thinking of reading more from J.R. Moehringer. If I ever want to learn about how to write autobiographies, I'd want to learn from that guy.Job well done! Good luck with the future books Harry!"
Careful Reader,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brave and Well Written - Calling his family to their higher selves,"I am so amazed at how well written this memoir is. I received my book yesterday and opened the package to look through it before I met with a client. I couldn't put the book down until the last few minutes before the client appointment began.It's written with beautiful, thoughtful detail letting us in to both Prince Harry's internal experience, as well as rooting us in the royal surroundings that he is so familiar with. It has the feeling of being a propulsive, gripping read yet it aims at covering deep, emotional terrain. And it's so inspiring that he is using his work here as an attempt to puncture the denial his family has around their generational dysfunction. He's written a fabulously crafted intervention, from the position of the scapegoat in his family - the one that was made to be ""bad"" so they could excuse their behavior.It's an amazing job, and he deserves lots of admiration for continuously calling his family toward the truth and toward their better selves. I hope it works, they deserve better lives than the ones they've attempt to defend and burrow into."
Rosemary Nissen-Wade,Reviewed in Australia on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish everyone would read this - not just quote from it.,"I wish people would read it all, with an open mind, rather than merely the sensationalised sound bites and misinterpretations. Unfortunately we live in an era when people are conditioned to want and believe the sound bites and the skewed interpretations of them, the more sensational the better.Harry, the supposed ‘thicko’, has shown himself in recent years to be an articulate, thoughtful man. It is the same with this book. OK, this is ghost-written, but it’s still done from his own account, put together using his own thoughts and words.He tells it like it is, as he sees it and has experienced it. That’s as close to honesty as any of us can get. (I recently wrote a memoir of my own, so I appreciate the difficulties.) Having recently read ‘Courtiers’ by Valentine Low (an author who is said to hold no great brief for Harry and Meghan) I absolutely believe the many machinations that go on behind the scenes with staffers and bureaucrats from various royal households scheming to sway the press favourably towards their own principals, even at the cost of blatant untruths.Even so, I was shocked to learn how many things I’ve read over the years have been outright lies - even things not especially nasty, but nevertheless completely made up so as to have and sell a story.By now - indeed, from early on - Harry and Meghan can’t win; for most of the press and social media, whatever they do or say, it’s wrong. That’s already the case with this book too. The outrage is already being confected. The book is selling well - but an even larger public, I think, is put off reading it at all because of what they have already been fed about this couple, and/or is believing the spin put on the bits taken out of context. To be fair, there are allegations which appear to be fair and deserved, and which have only been made now as a very last resort.It may be true, as some people are saying, that it was naive of him to write it. But keeping silent over the years didn’t do any good either. I understand his wish to get his truth out there: his own knowledge, feelings and recollections. I even applaud him for it.I only hope that, whatever people’s reactions, this author and his family may be able to find both the peace they crave and the work they are committed to. In fact, they seem to be doing all right so far in both respects, despite some serious challenges, since their move away from Britain. I think the troubles that befell them since their relationship began are no fault of their own, and they have earned the right to thrive."
kirribilligirl,Reviewed in Australia on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic truth telling.,"I loved this book. I also loved Harry’s determination to protect his wife and young family. It's an easy, interesting read and nowhere near as malicious as the press has suggested. Over the years, I've watched Princess Anne attacked cause she doesn't fit the role of a pretty princess. Who could forget the treatment of Princess Michael of Kent? Then the treatment of Sarah Ferguson (princess pork). Then the waity Katey headlines. Each time I thought, why do the Royals allow this? Diana’s death impacted Harry in such a way that he was unforgiving of the press, and when Megan arrived on the scene, racism entered the mix. Congratulations, Harry and Megan, for opting out of the incessant nastiness and undermining by the Royal Rota and tabloid journalists.The book educated me on what a determined and hard-working man Harry is. His time in the army and his dedication to being the best made for a fascinating read. This young man does not have a lazy bone in his body and is unafraid of hard work and striving to be the best he can be.Also, I found Charles and William to be very likable and suffering those tensions that all families have. I read nothing but love for his family, but he also recognized that their life and choices were not the ones for him and his family. Is there any family that hasn’t experienced this?Towards the end of the book Megan arrives, and this is a love story. They support each other and adore each other. Megan's an intelligent woman and an actual loss to the royal family. However, the firm is run by courtiers with no change from royal courts from 1066 onwards. What a vile group of people, and sadly kings and queens listen to their manipulation and rules. Yep, the royal family is awash with so many directions.Suppose you or thinking of reading this book to confirm your dislike about Harry and Megan. Save your money and keep reading the clickbait. However, if you want to understand how little we know about Harry, then read this book."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting Read, Surprising in many places","I was not sure if this would be a book I would enjoy.  It was an emotional read for me.  I get that many people feel that it is just whining and dont believe much of it.  Thats fine, everyone has their own opinion.  For me I look at this as it is Harry's truth.I read some of the other reviews saying it was not true as he could not remember dates or other details.  Really I cant remember dates for things that happened between my sister and myself.  I remember the stories and the emotions behind them but for the life of me I could not give you a date.  In addition my memories are different than my sisters.  We remember incidents but view them differently.  So I imagine it is the same for Harry.I enjoyed the stories of his life with his family.  Some were good some not so good.  I look at this as your typical family just with way more public opinions.It is definitely worth the read as far as I am concerned."
wndsrfn,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderfully written,"I’m not going to go into an overview of the book, as so many people have already done. What I will say is that it seems easy for so many people to say he should have just hidden himself and his family away so he doesn’t get any more publicity but how many of us would really not want to address all the lies told about their family? And, as he said, not commenting hasn’t exactly worked to stop the paparazzi.Also, since he was completely cut off from his father, he has to have a way to pay for living and security. His family is being threatened and I don’t think he can just go down the road and get a job at Lowe’s. The money given by his mother will not last long, especially in this economy.And with all the charity work that both he and Meghan have done, I’m sure they would love to go back out someday and continue to help others. Or should they just stay locked up in their house and hope the paparazzi eventually leaves them alone??I applaud them and wish their family all the best!"
esme,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare uses Prince Harry’s life to shed light on a serious problem that affects us all,"The best stories reach people on multiple planes: they are entertaining at a basic level, while also telling a more profound story that sheds light on aspects of the world  that we might not have otherwise known about. Spare on the surface appears as a titillating tell-all about one of the most famous celebrities in the world, a prince born of the iconic Diana, Princess of Wales, and grandson of the Queen of England. We read about the prince’s embarrassing and wild escapades, his frostbitten naughty parts, and other tabloid-level fare. But the book is so much more than that. It is about the tragic longing of a lonely and confused boy who never got the proper help he needed after his mother’s death.  And as all good stories have a villain, the villain in this book, haunting the struggling boy through every stage of his life, is Rupert Murdoch and his wretched media minions.For that is what this book really is about. The savage, destructive, and evil disinformation machine that plagued Harry is a threat to our entire civilization. What they did to Diana, what they are doing to Harry and his wife, they have done to all of Britain and the United States. These media monsters have destroyed any semblance of a shared reality among us, have divided us and manipulated us with disinformation about the world around us as surely as they have lied about and manipulated Harry and his family.  This book uses the Royal Family’s relationship with the tabloid press as an allegory to the mechanizations of the media disinformation machine against our civilization.  This is not hyperbole.  And no one in the Royal Family is safe from these monsters—they all, all of them, are threatened and controlled by this fake news cartel.It is not necessary to be a fan of Prince Harry to appreciate the larger scope of this book. I recommend it to anyone who’d like a closer look at the methods Murdoch and his cohort use to lie to and manipulate us."
SBurdorf,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest portrayal of a life lived in the public eye,"I hesitated to buy this book thinking it would be another diatribe against monarchy or an attempt by a displaced Royal to make money to make up for money lost when he and his wife left the royal system. I was very wrong. Yes, there is money to be had - but my understanding it is being donated to charities the former prince and his wife support. And yes, it is about leaving the monarchy, but it is about leaving the monarchy to save their souls and to protect their sanity. And really, who can blame them? When they very people who are supposed to be your support system let you down over and over and make you a scapegoat so their own foibles will be forgotten - well, you have to flee. Well done, Harry and Meghan. I have nothing but great respect for you both. Your children are lucky to have you as examples. My heart and hugs go out to you both. This book was honest and vulnerable and touching in ways I did not expect. I am glad I bought it."
mburks5938,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely,"Admittedly, I originally wanted to read the memoir in hopes of getting dirt or gossip on one of the most famous families in history. What I got was a lovely story, his story, told in 3 parts, each section discussing and highlighting pivotal moments in his life (his mother’s death, his military career and finding his love).I purchased the hardcover first but then decided on the audiobook as other people who had purchased it said that Harry’s reading was phenomenal. It was, the audiobook added to the experience. You hear, in his words, in his voice, the truth, his story, his life. The writing was very rich, the words creating vivid images.  It was like I could see everything he described. I literally laughed out loud at some of the recollections, other times heartbreaking, uttering an aww as I listened.At the end, I came away with a much better understanding of Prince Harry and all that he has been through. My compassion for him has grown exponentially.  Congratulations - this is an exceptional read. Wishing him and his lovely family all the best."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Am glad I read this book,"With this book just released a day ago, I have already watched and read so many petty criticisms of it.  Those views seem like more of the same old skewed and unkind press attempts to dehumanize a man whose life has been different from that of just about anyone else on the planet.  I found this book to be a transparent account of his personal experiences.  I disagree with a BBC critic who says the book lacks any outward focus.  Harry talks about his love and concern for orphaned children and families suffering with AIDS in Lesotho, about his love and concern for African wildlife, about his love and concern for wounded vets.  He speaks of his love for friends, fellow soldiers, family and friends.  I think he expresses with total clarity his understanding of how utterly abnormal his royal family dynamic is and how much he wants to experience a normal, healthy family life and make genuine contributions in the world.  After reading this autobiography what I feel for Harry is tremendous compassion, plenty of respect, and very best wishes for his happy future."
KG,Reviewed in Germany on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure which book the critics read, this one is really good","I usually don't review books that already have thousands of reviews. In this case I still do it, to show others that this is a really good book. I first ordered the kindle preview, expecting from the newspaper reports that it's really bad. After the preview I straight away ordered the book as I couldn't stop reading.The book is separated into 3 main parts.Plus the intro: the first few pages are very badly written. But it gets better!1) childhood and youths. Very interesting. Harry comments on many stories I remember reading at the time. Charles comes across as a really nice person.2) life as a soldier: I really had no idea what soldiers experience during their training and in a war zone. This feels very important to read.3) the story about Meghan and leaving the 'institution': well... this part is confusing. Harry wrote the book to explain in his own words why he left. I still don't get it. I'm not surprised his family doesn't either.It's interesting though. I wonder what Harry will think if he reads his own words in 10 years time. He tries to some extent to blame members of his family, but reading the book, I understand their behaviour and their confusion.Why I give this book only 4 stars, not 5:a) Harry is annoyed when others claim to know his thoughts. He does the same when he assumes the thoughts William has. It's only about five sentences, the proofreaders should have deleted themb) We all complain about our family from time to time. Unfair to put it in the book when William did this (only about 2 small sections which could have been deleted)"
Debrah Harrison,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,SPARE a real life experience,"SPARE, I felt a bit controversial buying this, however having read this book digesting each chapter I have a totally different view on Prince Harry.By this I mean that I see a grief stricken child left to deal with his emotional turmoil on his own.If Prince Harry had attended a state school there would have been intervention put in place to support his emotions and feelings.I am amazed he wasn’t destructive displaying behaviour complications through his grief being buried and not being acknowledged!His story is impactful and very concerning in many ways. He is an adult before he seeks a therapist. Long over due, even within his career in the forces there seemed little response of a duty of care towards him as a human being.Sadly Prince Harry could have had a more fruitful life had he received the  Care, displayed love & affection that he naturally craved. I feel his family damaged his mental health through doing nothing!Writing this book I hope has been a great healing process for him to work through his issues that have festered as a result of not standing up and dealing them, an adults job to protect the wellbeing of their family.He thankfully has acknowledged these issues and stood up to them  on his own steam as an adult.Well bloody done, your recovery journey is on its way.He perhaps should have asked for a proof reader from his forces days to read through in regard to speaking frankly about his military career prior to acknowledging the Kills.This I feel may have placed a target on him and his family, I certainly pray not!Well written, I enjoyed reading about Botswana. Really lovely, however that lifestyle is absolutely beyond the normal capacity of everyday hardworking people. He certainly had a gifted life style and ability to travel.Really enjoyed his book. :)"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,What the fifth estate won't tell you. It's good,"Yes, those of us old enough to have watched Harry on screen and in the press can now read the background to those images, and it's a good story, the ghost writing gives panache, but the inimitable voice of Harry, honest, straight, a bit fun and irreverent, comes through clearly.Yes, those of us old enough see history repeat itself, as a petulant prince again  separates himself from a more charismatic family member ( for Charles and Diana read Wills and Harry) and begins the negative briefings, the faux stories. It was so obvious, we could watch play out. Harry gives us the accusations, not the details. I'd have liked more detail hereYes, those of us who were ashamed of our country's venal red tops in their monetising and savaging of Meghan will know exactly why the couple upped sticks and left. And that has not changed.The book details how the same type of power brokers, press and the royal institution, that gave us the lies of Brexit, fed woke culture and rabid conservatism, now savage Harry for writing his truth about the family when they ignored his requests for help and cast him adrift to punish him for not toeing the line.How many palaces, Charles? 9 or 10? How many posh homes, Wills? 3 or 4, plus all that lovely dosh from the Duchy of Cornwall. And Harry got Frogmore, done up at his expense, not ours, and no police protection, while Andrew retains his for life. Not, that's not right or fair. Harry and Meghan had star quality and cv's with service, altruism and humanitarian work. The Spares were the real deal. The heirs were not. That's the nub of the problem, and why this book exists. I'm a republican, with a sense of history, and i bought this book to read Harry's  side of the royal debacle that has reshaped his life.He did us proud once he grew up, and his wife was a self-made woman who could have served us well, but was too good, wasted, in the restrictive life she'd married into.A good book. A cracking read. Losing Harry and Meghan, and all they  could have achieved, hit a lot of us hard. Leaving, and finding new income streams took courage and determination. They have every chance to thrive in their new life. I wish them well."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Touched,"Incredible! Just incredible! What a sad yet beautiful and courageous way for Prince Harry to find his voice. All three phases of his life story, the death of his mother (childhood); his search to garner an identity (young adulthood); his search for love, finding love and eventually finding himself is beautiful, courageous, and sadly compelling. After reading this book, I have to say the proverbs emphasizing the point that “the grass isn’t always greener on the other side,” is symbolic of Spare. Too much to say that I am not willing to write. However, I want the best outcome for all involve. I don’t believe that silence is golden, classy, or brave. I believe fighting for what’s true and right is courageous and brave. Given this, I applaud Prince Harry for taking control of the narrative. All the best to him and his family. Forget the haters. They will always hate. They shouldn’t even be considered. When you think too much about them (the media and its supporters), you give them too much power and control. Happiness is the best revenge."
hismusicnme,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is Incredible!,"I didn’t want this memoir to end! As someone who has had to learn to recognize what toxicity and abuse really behaves like, and how to confidently insist that others own their own accountability as no one else is capable of owning that for them, not even if we wanted to, I was was feeling all the feels in Prince Harry’s book. His journey, understanding and action had me finally understanding what had occurred and rooting for him, Meghan and their children all the way. I also do hope that his family will finally recognize the abuse they have been living under and have enabled and seemingly dished out as well. I pray they are all able to heal appropriately in time and with proper accountability. Only honesty, humility and real love can accomplish that. We can dream, right?This book is a must read regardless of who’s side you think you’re on going into it. The stories are eye opening and full of candor.

AMAREM,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let him speak his truth.,"One of the most hurtful thing in this world is to be accused of something you know you didn't do. The book is MORE THAN the controversies of today. Its a glimpse of Harry’s life in his own words. His own truth. I bought the book because of that. Its not some pseudo writer speculating and making money from “information from a reliable source”. So many pseudo journalists and publications are frothing in the mouth right now because Harry just took away their ability to make up stories and money at his expense.  At least Harry is accountable for everything he wrote in this book. This book set him free. Free to find and protect his happiness and most of all take away the power from those who makes a living exploiting, skewering and manufacturing stories for power and money. I wish you a happy life Harry. It doesn’t matter what others say. All you need is one person to know the truth and Im sure you a surrounded by more than a few.

Everything I have ever heard about Harry has been a lie. Has he been arrogant at times and foolish? Yes. Who hasn’t. It’s called growing up and learning. The difference is everything he’s ever done is attached to a headline and usually the headline was a fabrication. Sorry, but I’d be angry too. I hope the course of action Harry & Meg have taken for their family is successful and full of love. This book is excellent. I don’t pity Harry. He’s had a life of privilege, but he is still learning who he is outside of the bubble. He will always be chased by paps. It is unfortunate that he can’t just live his life. But read Spare for a very clear view of what you thought you knew being plain b.s. Come to admire him for continuing to put one foot in front of the other. Hear his words."
Krista,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic read,"I’ve always had a soft spot for Prince Harry. Would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in hearing about the years lasting affects that trauma can cause someone (and to do it all front and center, spotlighted, on the world’s stage!) He shows vulnerability, laced with humor, wit, connectedness/affection to his loved ones, appreciation and recognition of mistakes made, and a real side of the monarchy/royal family that isn’t the rose tinted lens we all saw the long-standing family through.We can all identify with the broken bits of our own family and find ourselves within his story. Goes to show, even the “blue bloods” are humans, with real struggles, pride, mistakes, and lessons which can be learned if willing to put in the time and work to amend and better oneself.Fast read for me… I could not put it down! I stayed up multiple nights well past bed time to finish each section.I’m glad that he was able to share his story with the world on his terms, in his words, and through the lens of his family. I hope it’s brought him some healing and closure where needed, as he’s breaking free and finding peace that he’s long wanted (as his mom wanted as well)."
JLH,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great look into the monarchy and figuring out your own life,"I just finished the book 10 minutes ago and cried for a few minutes… I know that a famous ghost writer helped  Harry  with this book…But that’s not the point… I thought he would come across as a whiny, entitled Prince. But he does not. He bares his soul in a moving and open way. He doesn’t really throw any of his family members under the bus… Maybe a few more than others… He is very kind to his father. But if what he says is true, they deserve to be called out. I think primogeniture is awful. It has been written about in books for centuries. Just beautifully written and beautifully told. I love the details about the life in the monarchy, English countryside, and so forth, because I like details about other peoples lives, and this book really delivers on that… I could just see myself walking through various palaces. I feel proud of Harry. Hopefully this book will help him pay his security since he was cut off like his mother was who was killed in the tunnel in Paris. She was cut off after she divorced Charles one year earlier. Shame on the British monarchy."

He and Megan now top my list of celebrities I’d most like to meet!While it would be awesome if he could mend fences with his family, that may not happen.  To him I say: move on with your life.

Charles,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Spare,"Excellent, loved the content and the delivery. I wasn't going to buy this book, I like Prince Harry but didn't consider myself that emotionally invested. However, I changed my mind when I realised that the British media was just going to bombard me with a pile of mistruths and brainwashing spin.  Wish I'd been wrong about that. So I'm glad I did buy it, Prince Harry's story is interesting, honest, funny and brave. Anyone with critical thinking skills would have realised long ago that the British media has been gunning for him since his youth, never mind after he started dating Meghan. Harry's book takes to task some of those ""reporters"" and ""royal correspondents"", so called ""writers"" who have used him to ""pay their rent"" by writing countless unauthorised books and articles on him. Harry does this by pulling out key points of his life and explaining what really happened versus their spin. The same people who have spent most of their time trying to convince everyone that Prince Harry shouldn't be writing his own story, he's trashing the royal family they cry, even calling him a traitor... Two tours of Afghanistan, and a life of royal service, more of a patriot than any of us will ever be.This isn't a hatchet job on his family as the British media would have everyone believe, his family are part of Harry's life story so obviously feature. There is stuff in the book that will definitely raise a few eyebrows, but my take is, if the truth paints any of his family in a bad light, they should have done better and have the opportunity to do better in the future.My other take is on the British Media, how scary is that power? For those unaware, this book lays it bare and they do not like it and have ramped up their mission to seek and destroy. I had made the decision long before Harry's book to avoid the tabloids and even some broadsheets, it has left me wondering exactly where to get any truthful news in the UK. The way most citizens in the UK have turned on Prince Harry shows that power in real time, for the first time ever I'm embarrassed to be British. From comments, I can now tell those who have read this book using critical thinking skills versus the media fed ""I'm not going to read it because he's a traitor & trashing his family"" camp. How can telling the truth trash his family, surely by definition they've trashed themselves?I'm left feeling happy for Prince Harry and wish him, Meghan and their family further success and happiness. In truth, the only thing that upset me about this book was that it wasn't long enough."

I clicked the pre-order as soon as it was announced! I almost came to tears when on about page 2? Harry opened up with a memory, THE memory that made me  fall in deep like with someone that I never even met; him holding on to his father's hand at 12 years old, after his mum tragically died. I remembered feeling so much empathy for that boy who was trying to read every note, while seeking comfort from his father. I hadn't stopped liking him since, although I never really followed his life. Of course I saw news bits. It was enlightening to hear his side of those news bits. Besides all the drama in recent years, I am just so thrilled that Harry has finally found his voice, and his family (his wife and children). I hope he made peace with the garbage British media bring garbage but I support his fight to call them out, holding them accountable for the filth. Cheers Harry."

Über 400 Seiten. Das hätte wirklich etwas anstrengend werden können. Erklären, zerreden von längst dokumentierten Geschichten. Aber Spare ist genau das nicht. Es nimmt dahin mit, wo Journalisten nicht sind und zeigt gut geschrieben, dass es verschiedene Welten und Wahrheiten über das Leben eines Königssohnes gibt. Harry nimmt uns mit in seine und die ist häufig überraschend anders als geschrieben und gedacht. Einfacher und gleichzeitig komplizierter. Ein seltsam verlorener junger Mann, dennoch zu großer Liebe und großen Taten fähig.Harry wird in der Geschichte des englischen Königshauses keine offizielle Rolle mehr haben. Aber für die Geschichte desselbigen am Ende des zweiten Elisabethanischen Zeitalters eine  bedeutende einnehmen. Der Sohn, der das Werk seiner Mutter fortgesetzt hat: Liebe statt Arrangement, Freiheit statt so tun als ob, Aufrichtigkeit statt Arroganz und vor allem Mut, den goldenen Käfig zu entzaubern und zu überwinden…dafür wird er gleichermaßen geliebt wie gehasst.Menschen mögen es nicht, wenn an ihren Träumen und Mythen gerüttelt wird. Doch von Zeit zu Zeit müssen diese auf den Prüfstand. Wir leben in einer solchen Zeit. Wir dürfen uns bewusst werden, dass es neue Träume braucht für eine schönere Welt.

L. Glenn,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insightful book of a human reflecting on an abnormal life,"This beautiful written book is a heartfelt exploration of what it's like to grow up in a fishbowl and to navigate the currents that confine you when all you want is liberation, the freedom to be a fallible human, the freedom from unreasonable expectations - from the ones who put you in the fishbowl (family/the Firm) and the press and gp who gawp and gossip relentlessly. Harry reflects on his life, the experiences that made him who he is, and his own responses to them, both good and bad. He allows the reader into his ongoing exploration as he looks back at all that led him to flight to a life in California. He's not done peeling back the onion, but he's done a lot of work to see as clearly as he can from his current vantage point. Like all humans, his perspectives now may develop and deepen as he moves further away from the confined fishbowl life, but he vulnerable offers us a window into his present perceptions. And this time it's his choice."

If anyone is reading this book to read salacious tales of the Royal family, they’d be sadly mistaken. Harry writes the truth about HIS life, warts and all. The “Firm”, running the households, the ever quiet and sullen family and the British press are all scoundrels in hounding people literally to their deaths.  Add in a woman who had an affair with the future King, BEFORE, DURING and AFTER his marriage appears to be the one source of leaks to the press to build herself and her weakling husband up, while tearing his children to shreds. The Queen and Charles could have put up a fight but CHOSE NOT TO. Camilla, ever, the manipulative mover and shaker is best friends with her book writer/author/editor, former Daily Mail bigwig.

In fact I didn’t even realize until I read this book that the prince and I were the same age.As an American, royalty has always sat on the outside of my vision. More the stuff of fairytales than reality. How many of us really know or can know what it truly means?But the perfectly human things in this book told me that while I’ve never been brought fish sticks on a silver platter, the prince and I have things in common.Grief. Anxiety. Humanity.I will never know what it is to fly a military helicopter, but I know the pain and trauma and buried memories of losing someone.Parasocial relationships, “celebrity “, tabloids. It is all something I struggle to understand. And this book just reinforces that for me.This book is a richly written capsule of moments. Many the world has obsessed over many small, intimate, “inconsequential “.A fascinating look at a world most of us can only speculate about.I definitely recommend. And I wish these people peace."
Brandi Smith,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eyes wide open!,"What an interesting read. Reading about the life of the most loved and respected member of the Royal family was so insightful. Hearing from the man him self, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex is what is most important. When you have had you ""life/life experiences"" being told by the media since he was a boy and ""memoirs"" written about him when he reached manhood, it was nice to finally hear about Prince Harry's life from Prince Harry's mouth. Some of the things he exposed in his memoir paint a picture of the Royal family as they have never been seen before. A side that they hide by working closely with media to continue pushing a narrative of the perfect family. From jealousy between two brothers to jealousy between two brothers and their father. A step mother who is desperate to rehabilitate her image and a sister n law who thinks its appropriate to let a lie spread like a wildfire to help spread the image of a wilted rose. Interesting read and I urge anyone who is on the fence about purchasing this memoir to buy it."
Yogimason,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The truth through trauma: an emotional experience shared,"Harry eloquently put into words his experience surrounding the surreal moments he lived through that the world bore witness to and those that he held most private. Sharing his story felt like a therapeutic journey through the past 25 years of bits and pieces of his life as portrayed through the media and his response to their twisting of the truth as they wanted it seen. Harry took every opportunity to set the record straight and justify his actions even when he knew that they weren’t always right but more that it never intended as he was portrayed. The witch hunt nightmare that he has lived through since the devastating loss of his mother that haunts him to this day, with the one strong resolve of Enough is Enough. Having had no voice to speak for himself publicly, suppressed and silenced by the institution he committed his life to, this is a book that breaks all the barriers that institution so cautiously hides behind to reveal nothing but the truth. Beautifully written."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected. Most enjoyable!,"Wow! I expected a book about airing of dirty laundry like many of the presses say but it’s NONE OF THAT. There’s clear express of love and understanding for his family, his royal family and the one with Megan. I’m so in awe of how insightful and worldly his perception of life and of society around him. For someone who debased himself to being uneducated (not going to a university) and “spoiled”, he sure has a better view and understanding of the world and the people in them than any of the people around him, maybe that’s why he chose this life’s path. He was able to see outside the fish bowl and decided to venture into the uncertainty of the big ocean beyond royalty, seeing that it has more possibilities for a happier life. I can’t see why anyone could say or write anything negative about Megan either. She’s just the girlfriend then the wife. Harry has always been the driver of his own life."
Carrie,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Daring, courageous truth-telling","I just finished this book, after devouring it within a few days. Well-written, this memoir was surprisingly a page-turner to this American who has little interest in the monarchy.What I find so compelling is Harry and Meg's continual fight for truth and justice, not only for themselves, but for others who are affected by the heinous tactics of the British press.I am a fan of anyone bringing darkness to light, particularly when that darkness is within a powerful institution that is unfamiliar with accountability.Taking on such an institution is only done at great cost to the truth-teller, and Harry has done just that in this memoir.He takes pains to tell his story fairly, generously pointing out the good as well as the bad. He does not paint the royals as all evil, but gives grace to speak charitably when possible, as well as freely admitting his own mistakes.I admire Harry for telling his story at great personal cost, and applaud him and Meg for doing the right thing, no matter the cost."
Amy Ortiz,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling Memoir,"Well-written and SO interesting. Prince Harry is honest, but fair and always respectful when writing of his family and the Sussex’s decision to step away from royal life. Although he reveals a lifetime of intermittent disagreement and frustration with his brother and father, he also shares poignant memories of happy times with them throughout his life, and his deep love and respect for them is never far from sight.I hope Harry and Meghan’s openness and honesty will be the beginning of some real change in the monarchy. Not since Diana’s tragic death has such a compelling case been made for Britain to get a handle on its out-of-control paparazzi, which cites “public interest” as its justification for driving these people to the brink of insanity. (Not that this issue applies exclusively to the British press.) This book is a bold and compelling account of the stories the press doesn’t tell.I do hope that in time, we will be able to read the next volume of Harry and Meghan’s love story in their own words."
Lucie Harris,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderfully Captivating,"I absolutely loved reading Spare. Hearing from Prince Harry's perception of how things happened gave me a lot to think about in how here in America Harry and Megan have been portrayed by the media.  I loved reading about the love he still holds for his mummy and how precious his father addressed him although he had no idea how to show love. Nothing really surprised me about William.I think this is a great read for old and young. I salute Harry for his honesty about his drug use and mental health. Having lost my mother unexpectedly at 8 years old I don't think any child doesn't suffer mental agony for years because of that. I salute Harry for his military service and love for his country and brothers and sisters who have served. I think that America is lucky to have Harry and Megan and the British people should stand up to the press and demand they do better then how they have treated Megan especially. The racist headlines are absolutely unacceptable and those that wrote them should all be fired.Finally I wish for Prince  Harry and his family all the joy, happiness and freedom the universe has to offer. Great book Prince Harry! Bravo!"
Patricia,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An informative and touching work,"What a really beautiful book. Well written, informative, his truth and his humor are right up front. It took a great deal of courage to put his life experience out there. Those of us who have followed his life and who have experience working with young people have watched as he fought through the pain and anxiety, the difficulty in coping with the dysfunctionals who took over after Diane was killed. I often was moved to tears by his story and then I would laugh out loud at his escapades. I was always suspicious at the rosy picture of the brother relationship. In many ways because of William's temper, obvious from an early age. Meghan is a woman who came into his life and understood him. Bless her. As I watched his interviews I saw a Harry that I always knew existed,  charming, humourous, extremely intelligent, very well spoken, compassionate, strong and an admirable human being. Best wishes to him and his wife and children. They are a lovely family."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His deepest feelings came through,"It could not have been easy to bare his feelings while never trashing his family, as they richly deserved.  This is a young man needing the love and help of his own family and never being viewed as anyone important to them.  Then, when he needed their support to protect his family, they turned their backs.  He never said anything rude or hateful about his family, but instead, you come to know him as his own person.  He has spent his life feeling unvalued, not mattering, when he needed them the most.  Of course the reviews from the UK are not good...who do these reviewers actually work for?  The various Press interests..... the same ones that have been trashing him for years.  There are two sides to every story.  This is his side...moving, sad, and yet victorious, when he takes charge of his own life, even if it means a struggle to start over again.  BRAVO, HARRY!"

I felt bad that the press destroyed his family's relationship with each other and the close bonds that he had with his father and his brother.I keep feeling that this was a horrible way for a family to deal with the press and with each other and I really hope at some point that his family can heal.Plus his family does not back each other on anything they just attack each other like members of the show Succession...It's pretty horrible. Would not want to be a member of that family and I'm glad I'm not.All in all it's a good read and it gives you really good insight into the firm, the press, the British tabloids and the horrible way British people treat each other."

You'd think SOMEONE would make laws to prevent this crap. Proof that we need better representation.And, a glimpse in the insanity that is life as a royal.

L.G. Smith,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good King Harry,"For reasons I can't quite explain, I've been emotionally invested in Harry's journey since the day his mother died. Always keeping one eye on his progress, one eye on his mishaps, knowing the undercurrent of experiencing death at a young age and in in the glare of the spotlight was the one constant he'd have to swim against his entire life. I remembering being impressed by his military service, for his work in Africa and with veterans, and by the warm relationship he seemed to have with his grandmother.  It's impossible for me, as an American, to understand the recent vitriol thrown at this man and his new wife by the British press. What purpose could so much hate serve other than to sell newspapers to hate-filled readers? Or perhaps to discredit a member of the royal family whose favorability ratings were higher than the more 'senior' royals? Despicable either way. I wanted to read the book for myself and I'm glad I did. Welcome to America, Harry."
Tallteacher64,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thoughtful, Sometimes Brutal, Always Compelling","Amazing book! This is an incredible look at the life of a man born into an untenable familial situation. Harry's life thus far is a portrait of strength, determination, and ""becoming,"" all while dealing with the strictures of being born into the most famous and famously disfunctional family in history. I was truly angry for Harry. The British press is disgusting and the diabolical arrangement they have with the royal family is unconscionable. I've always been a fan of the British monarchy, but not anymore. I have disliked Charles since ""Tampongate,"" but he truly is a spineless milksop for not protecting his son and his family. Camilla's villainy is well-established, and no amount of PR cooperating with the tabloids will change that fact, at least for this reviewer. William is an entitled jerk and his wife is a stuck-up prude. Perfect future king and queen.I'm am firmly on Team Harry and Meghan, and I look forward to seeing what they accomplish and all of the good they put into the world."
Eileen O,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking,"I wasn’t sure what I wanted from this book. Juicy scandals or plain facts.  What I did get from this book is a gut wrenching story of a boy who was traumatized severely as a child, grew up with a distorted view of the world and finally finds maturity and fulfillment as a man.Harry guides us through his life from the death of his mother until today.Learning that for years he believed that his mother was still alive and in hiding is heartbreaking. The PTSD that was allowed to fester for decades is just criminal. The gradually developing rift between himself and his brother that turns into a Grand Canyon sized separation is sad.  The degree to which the tabloids tormented Harry and Meghan before they made the decision to split is laid out in detail.While this book is set against the backdrop of royalty and fame, I can see the petty jealousies and spite play out anywhere.It took guts to lay himself bare for the world to see.  People will come down as either on his side or on his family’s side in this depending in their points of view.  I would ask that you read the book with an open mind and allow yourself to feel what he is saying rather than having a knee jerk reaction to the narrative."
Steve,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating and disconcerting,"The book is fascinating for the obvious reason that it gives an inside view of life as a member of the Royal family, but also because of the personality of Prince Harry that emerges. Early on, he writes: ""There's just as much truth truth in what I remember and how I remember it as there is in so-called objective facts"". Really?The reader is left not knowing what to believe and what not to believe. The picture that emerges is, overall, a sad one. It is hard not to share Harry's anger and grief at devastating, and often untrue, media coverage. But the overwhelming picture that emerges is of a deeply troubled person with many of his woes being more about his difficulties in coping than about what others may, or may not, have done to him. It is easy to understand why he felt compelled to write it. Hard to imagine that he will do other than come to regret it."
Rosemarie,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting read,"My heart goes out to both Harry and Meghan. How awful to live in a fish bowl. I think some people don't see them as real human beings. Losing a Mother at a young age is a very tramatic event, that changes who you are. My siblings and I lost our Mom in a fire . We were 6, 10 , 12. It has affected us to this day. I also fantisized that my Mom was in hiding from an abusive situation. That happens when you don't see for yourself that they are dead. In my opinion I think Harry had every right to tell his story. I am sure his Mom is very proud of him. He and his family deserve to live their life happy and free. In the end, you have to do what is best for your well being. I wish them Godspeed. Live your best life. People should read this book without bias. With their hearts open."
Jewelzy,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Astounding,"This gives you a look inside a very personal time,in the life of another we would otherwise speculate how they must live. I was moved by the honesty,for perception is one's reality. I could never understand or want to, the depth of fear and unsettlement that one would feel living this way. Despite what others say,whether it's the papers or the crown and the crown to be,Harry is and has never been the spare. He walked to his own beat and came into his own self when he wanted for that,I give him great respect. No matter how poor or rich,prince or commoner we all have the same sort of problems and we definitely have the same feelings of hurt and forbodence. I was moved ,saddened, happy all at once reading this. It will definitely make you stop and think about the freedom's we have in America,the freedom to be whoever and whatever we want.And to be kind always to those we know and don't know."
E. L. Garvey,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A truthful and very sad account of the monarchy and the troubled individuals.,"I hope that Harry and Meghan can find happiness in the United States. Harry seems to be very much like his mother. He truly wants people to be happy and he wants to live a life of service. Meghan seems to be his perfect match. He is well rid of the toxic relationships the other royals foster. He was repeatedly abused and denied true caring love by his brother and father after his mother's death. They will continue to live on the hamster wheel they seem to enjoy. I understand their lives are at best difficult, but to feed false info to the press and do nothing to correct it is disgusting. Honestly they are all about at a junior high level of ""mean girls"". If the press had been reprimanded from the very beginning, they might not have been so quick to right such outrageous stories. So, good luck in the US to Meghan and Harry. Yes we have lots of issues here but hopefully they will eventually find peace."
Cville reader,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A story of emotional neglect and trauma turned into mission,"This book is well written and a very fast read. The takeaway from this memoir is this: two boys were left to the emotional neglect of a parent who himself was emotionally neglected as a child.  Harry's father abdicated much of his parental decision-making responsibility to outsiders within the institution of the monarchy who refused to permit the boys therapy after the death of their mother.  Most parents assume that if they die prematurely, the other parent or relatives will take good care of their children and raise them well. Sadly this did not happen. Harry has managed to successfully grow into a man who protects his wife and children and uses his privilege to support injured vets.  His memoir makes it clear he has suffered from PTSD on top of the emotional scars he bore long before going to war.  His willingness to share so much personal detail may serve a greater purpose."
Leslie A. Robinson,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Remarkable narration by Prince Harry of his beautifully written memoir; hardcopy compelling as well,"I am a long-time fan of Harry and Meghan's so I was excited to dig into this memoir. Was I ever surprised by how excellent the audiobook is!  I really didn't expect the storytelling to be so emotional; it's in the words but doubly so in Prince Harry's delivery.  He should be very, very proud.Let me just add that I have both the hardcopy and the audiobook; I found the best experience was to listen and read along.  There is poetry in the words in print, and credit must be given to the talented ghostwriter JT Moehringer as well as Prince Harry. It is remarkable that much as we know about Harry's public life, his memoir is suspenseful, revealing and insightful.  Here's a man committed to his own development, to standing up for what's right, to showing love and compassion despite his pain. An outstanding book."
Sally Dinovo,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes,"The very beginning blew me away.  The in depth  description of the grounds and Harry's thoughts as he waited for his brother and father was phenominal. I was hooked.  I thought the war went on a little too long for me, but I kept thinking my son would really like that part. I understand Harry wanted to show what men go through in war. Being a huge fan of anything royaI .( I watched queen Elizabeth's coronation on tv in 1953. ), I sort of knew the rules  etc. I still don't understand after what happened with Dianna, the family would not help. It probably won't change anything but I think writing this book was a good thing to do.  I think the family and the Queen thought if they took everything away Harry and Meghan would have to come back. We are behind you whatever you decide. Great read. Had a hard time putting it down. Well done."

Overcoming the mental pains of death that grab hold of the mind, forever seeking answers where there was none. It’s about utilizing that gripping hold of death for purpose in the military. It’s about releasing the restrictive thoughts of dying, replacing it with the intense need to live after finding love. It’s about a journey in therapy, and overcoming, coming out on the other side whole. It’s lots of laughs and lots of smiles, from Prince Harry’s cheeky narratives, making it an easy listen and making the book an easy read. It’s about New Beginnings forged with strength of purpose, like seeing his child emerge from the womb, Prince Harry is no longer defined as a Spare, but a Man confidently making his own path Independent of the obstacles of Palace Family intrigue. #SPARE is exciting with superb narration by the author, it leave you with hope that obstacles and walls are never permanent.

Hope Cummiskey ,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read with an open mind.,"After reading SPARE, my heart breaks for Prince Harry. Though he has many flaws, which he openly and honestly shares with the reader, he is above all else a human being. Unlike what the British press and some unkind ""royal experts"" have said, he doesn’t throw members of his family under the bus. His father, the King, comes off much better than I thought he would, and Harry says nothing unkind towards the late Queen. He is most critical, and rightly so, of the British press, the paparazzi, and the scheming palace insiders who leak false stories about one royal in order to take the heat off another. Harry details how unfairly his wife has been treated in comparison to other Royals, particularly Kate. Google avocados if you don’t believe me.SPARE isn’t about Harry’s grievances or exacting revenge upon his family. Far from it. This is the story of the emotional implications of a child losing his mother at such a critical age and how that follows you throughout your life. This is one man's journey, often bordering on self-destruction, to break free from his fears and toxicity to find a more peaceful existence.SPARE is going to stir up emotions, and this review will not be popular with everyone. However, I urge you, regardless of how you feel about Harry and Meghan, to read it with an open mind."
Crazy woman,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the journey,"If you’ve experienced trauma you’ll likely feel a loving attachment to Harry and connect with him through his life’s journey, even if you’re not royalty. You’ll understand his cause, and feel his extreme heartache and soaring love.Trauma does things to some people that it doesn’t do to others. Harry’s journey, with a desire to be accepted and know he was loved by family is a sadly familiar story. When family’s are broken from it there seems to always be conflict and a need for a scapegoat. When the scapegoat breaks free it sets the rest of the family on its end, and that is ever present in Harry’s world.I’m so glad he chose to share his journey. If you read it and think he’s whining, complaining or so privileged he should suck it up, perhaps you’re a villain—you’ll never get it. And that’s why there’s an ocean between Harry and the royals.

I'm furious with the press and the palace's clear complicity in aiding, abetting and augmenting the racism and misogyny.  But I'm also awestruck by the grace and self-reflection Harry demonstrates. Moreover, his ability to truly articulate what's happening and what's wrong with our society that refuses to hold actual stalkers accountable. I had to take breaks because it was so emotionally raw in places. At other times, I broke down in tears at the horror of what was and is happening to this family. I'm in PR and politics and have seen this play out in the non-royal world as well. Power will fight to retain power, and sycophants that profit off that power are ruthless and vicious.

It was so pure that I ordered the hard cover. Prince Harry was thrown into the public sector since he was born so it is only appropriate that he would use the same forum to tell his story. The Royal family has been silenced for far too long by bad PR and people deserve to know ""his"" truth. Hopefully Harry's truth and Diana's nightmare become a tool for change with the paparazzi and how celebrities can be attacked stalked and even killed.

Therapy that should have been given him starting the day after his mother died.He also is self aware and not whining about his life. I don't think his descriptions of his family interactions are spiteful whatever the press is saying. He was deeply hurt by their refusal to help him and his wife survive truly spiteful and dangerous hate mongering.This could have been a Mommy Dearest if a book but I think he had to speak up about the destruction of his family's happiness by heartless amoral 'journalists' who committed crimes and didn't even get a slap on the wrist from the very institution that was supposed to be protecting him.If someone treated my child or grandchild that way they'd be in their own personal hell devised by me.So give it an unbiased read.

Gives an insight into the royal bubble and the pressures of being in the spotlight.There is a solid theme of entitlement; Harry casually talks of playing polo in Brazil or visiting a game reserve in Africa as the average Joe might talk about going to Bournemouth for the weekend. Free housing in Kensington Palace also comes across as a burden. There wasn’t one point during this book where I thought he understood the depth of his privilege versus a normal, average person. However, he is admirably candid about his mental health struggles.Like any story, there are two sides and we can only read one version here. There were parts of book that garnered more sympathy than others. Overall, the book has not positively changed my opinion of him but it was worth reading - if not for the stellar writing, for the fact it’s a unique moment in publishing."

I just want to hug them both, and wish them well.  He did the right thing leaving.  I thought U.S. media was bad…Britain, takes it to whole other level of low.

It has the ring of truth, is beautiful written by an obviously excellent ghostwriter, and is filled with pathos. Harry is emotionally fragile, having been persecuted, hounded and abused by the British press all his life, whilst also being born into a dysfunctional and emotionally distant family, and, of course, losing his mother at an early age. When Meghan comes into his life, a 'palace insider' ups the ante, turning  the newly-weds lives into a living hell by leaking cruel, groundless stories to the press. But the biggest betrayal is that this persecution seems to be condoned, or even arranged, by Harry's own father and brother. All of us who have ever believed the press's lies should be deeply chastened by this book and reach out to this couple with our love and apologies. This is yet more evidence of the media's utter deceit and depravity."
Marie,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,In His Words,"First off a lot of people are hating on this book without having read it. The one thing I’ll say is this: most of the quotes you see are posted without context or put in a way to make it look bad. Harry even managed to humanize Charles and make people understand him more, something, I have to admit, I’d never thought I’d say.I’m glad to finally have Harry’s story through his words and not the words of every single person who has an opinion on this and the tabloids.There’s a lot of grief in this book, a lot of grief that was repressed for a long time. If writing this book gave Harry the peace he needed, then I’m glad he did.One thing is clear, he loved the Queen dearly and without shame.« In every photo of us, whenever we’re exchanging a glance, making solid eye contact, it’s clear: We had secrets.”"
Dewi R,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,You just have to read it,"I’m glad I read this and I really feel for Harry and Meg. I hope he knows that many of us never had a bad impression of him. Ever. Not when he was a younger man or made mistakes. We all make mistakes. I never judged him from press reports. I guessed that he struggled from losing his mom so young, but I never knew how much. His book is well written and quite riveting and he seems like a wonderful, good-hearted man. I hope he and Meghan find peace and privacy and don’t get more backlash and cold shoulder from just telling his whole truth. He deserves better. Wishing them well and hope they can ignore the haters. It was so interesting to hear about his love of Africa and the military/veterans. hope he can continue his humanitarian work in the places he loves and that this all has a happy ending."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I have read many biographies, autobiographies and memoirs over my lifetime and this is without a doubt one of the best.  Kudos to Prince Harry for his honesty, maturity, spirituality, earnestness, righteous anger, levity, loving personality and truthfulness.  Thank you for sharing your story, warts and all.  What a life and what a hard won journey to self understanding, even if still a work in progress.  And shame on the naysayers,  press and cynics who have denigrated your versions of reality.  Thank you for your service in the military and for telling that story....it was quite eye opening.  Thank you for your compassion towards wounded veterans, children and the animal kingdom.  Thank you for sharing your family with us, especially your love for Meg, Archie and Lili.  I wish you joy and all good things from now on.  You have earned them!  💓"
Laura K,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised at how loving the book is,"I wondered if Harry was going to blast the the royal family for their treatment of him. Was it going to be a whiny-victim fest?  It was not. Reading the book led me to feel sad for them all. I can hear the love and the pain that resides in the souls of all of Harry's family. Harry's love for his family is evident throughout the book. I could see how much Harry appreciated his dad's loving words and actions towards Harry in a number of situations. Harry used gentle words to describe these scenarios. So many years ago, I remember watching Harry and William greeting the crowd and walking behind their mom's coffin. It seemed cruel- How could they do this to these boys? I remember wondering who in the world thought that was a good idea. Throughout his life, Harry has only wanted to be free to just walk somewhere without being harassed, stalked, and photographed. He just wanted to be a normal person who could walk upon the earth in freedom. Harry never had a safe, personal space in which to just ""be.""  No safe space to grieve and to heal. He now has that place and I am so happy that the United States has welcomed Harry and his family to live as they want to live. I wish the family well. I hope they can move past their differences and love one another in a spirit of acceptance and reconciliation. I also hope the family can read his book and see how much Harry loves and needs them in his life. I recommend this book if you like reading books about people figuring out their lives and wanting to move forward as they learn new ways to love one another."
Tracy Whittle,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very well written.,"This book is very well written and to gut the haters out there, it wasn't disrespectful to his family at all.  I am, however, very disappointed with his family.  After all the training he received and the blood and sweat he put into the military, he was denied wearing a uniform to the Queen's funeral.  That makes me so damn mad.  As to the rest of it, the royal family should care a less about where he lives and the life he choses.  He's earned that right as the ""spare""and as a loving member of that family.  I don't understand why they're so up in arms when he wouldn't be King anyways.  King Charles should let go and let Harry ""be happy"" just as Harry wanted him to be happy when he married Camilla.  I could go on but you have to read the book.  It was such an easy read that I finished it in one day."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare  spoilers contained,"I enjoyed this book. I know in the UK it's being touted as a lie and a farce. I choose to believe it is the truth. The Heir is always given more attention to his studies to learning his role as future King. I can see everything Harry said to be honest. If you remember what happened to his mother? How the press crucified her to almost killing herself. How sad that the family had to leak stories to the press. How the Brits are very reserved and the back stabbing from Charles and Camilla to make them look better. Then the final insult firing Harry, taking away his special charities, removing his security guard and taking away his salary. What kind of family does the things they did to him. He just wanted the truth to be told and the press with their lies punished. I encourage anyone who wants to read the other side of the story to read this book."
Laura A. King,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I’m a commoner.,"This book makes me glad I’m a commoner. It really touches on the life of a Royal. Never really being hugged and everything being stiff and rigid. There were a few glimpses of normalcy with his mother and the Queen and Queen Mother. A few tender moments with his father. More than anything it was a very interesting read. I wasn’t really all about the gossip of who said or did what. I really bought the book to take a look into the life of being a Royal and also most importantly how he felt after his mother died so devastatingly. I remember where I was when I heard about Diana’s car crash and I’ve always felt a sense of protection for the boys, especially Harry being so young.  I’m aware that I don’t know them but as a mother myself, I felt that sense of wanting to protect them.  Wonderful read."
Ana H.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful....,"I am so happy I got this book. It was beautiful write and I really enjoyed reading it. I am glad Harry found someone that he loves, that he built a family that he adores and adores him. You can think whatever you want about Meghan- personally I don't have anything against her, actually I believe she is a normal person with problems like everyone else and was demonized by the UK press- that being said, she really help him change his life, without her he would be at the same place and situation and now he is free. You can still see he is hurt, he does want his family back, not the institution but I am afraid he won't get, people need to want to change and I don't think they want, I also believe he will be in peace with that.Anyway, you won't regret this great book."
ehj,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brave, honest, soul-baring, total, transparency - mission accomplished.","If you have even a passing interest in who this person is beyond the tabloid lies and the gleam of the crown, I can't recommend this memoir highly enough to you. The writing is excellent. I found it to be an absolutely captivating, sweeping, utterly surprising, often get-wrenching recounting of Prince Harry's life so far - much of it as a die-hard soldier in active combat with the Taliban; all of it as a struggling human.And that's before Meghan Markle even enters the picture more than halfway through the book; after that, the harrowing description of what plays out renders the reasons for Harry and Meghan's escape across an ocean and a continent undeniably beyond reproach.In direct opposition to the monarchy, Harry's goal here appears to be transparency, come what may and even if this is to his own detriment at times. Brave, honest, soul-baring, total, transparency - mission accomplished."
Lindy,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A ""must read"" ... but ....","I strongly urge you to read this book, rather than all the garbage gossip and ""commentary"" that has been or is being churned out about it. Read what Harry and the book actually say, I recommend, and draw your own conclusions. In my opinion, this man is not whining, not stupid, not unreasonable, and he has a serious story to tell.As for the way the book is crafted, written, and edited, I thought the first third was really well done. But then - and here comes my complaint - the middle sagged and dragged (although the information there is very important), and the final third seemed rushed, chopped up, incomplete, and not nearly as well written as the first third. Just sayin'. I also felt that the book kept wavering between being a sometimes-rambling, adolescent autobiography and a clear, insightful, well-focussed memoir. That's the writer's and editors' failing, and it's too bad.Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book, and was deeply moved by how often Harry's story helped me pinpoint parts of not just his story, but of my own. I think many others may find parts of their lives here, too. I fully appreciate the courage and integrity it surely took this man to give us this book."
dachsiefan,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth reading,"After reading this book, I can't help but see Harry as just a man who suffered most of his life, living in a fish bowl, never having the support of his family when he needed it the most, feeling lost and adrift in a world not of his choosing.  He shows that he is human, with all the mistakes, regrets, and bad decisions like most of us.  I just can't imagine the pain of losing his Mother who appeared to be the only one capable of showing him real love, tenderness and affection.  Having Meghan come into his life was the greatest gift, and actually I am proud of them for leaving the environment in which they suffered and found a new life for their family where they can blossom.  Shame on the newspapers, the tabloids and the paparazzi.  Shame on the Royal Family for not standing up to the abusers."
Lisa,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding!,"Congratulations to Harry on sharing his impressive story!His frustrations were warranted and expressed, yet he kept rolling with his duties, year after year. He went above and beyond with service to his family and country.The Royals messed up royally and botched a perfect opportunity to make strides with the new couple’s experiences and views. Harry and Meg offered fresh air to the stuffy institution. I hope the Royal Family can overcome their differences. It saddens me what has become of the relationship between Diana’s boys.People remember where they were when they received the news about Diana. Many Americans, myself included, went to sleep not knowing if Princess Diana would survive. The following morning, the newspaper was on my bed with a huge headline and that’s how I found out. I burst into tears. The paparazzi took our girl.Harry did the right thing for his new family. I highly recommend this book. Excellent from start to finish!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking and Funny,"What I love about this book is how easy it is to relate to Harry. To see how normal he is and how he faced many of the same feelings we all do despite his royal status. Certainly, he faced different problems, but this isn't a matter of whose problems were worse. I love how he's truthful. This isn't a book bashing his father and brother. In fact, he mentions many fond memories. However, he is truthful about some things. Harry tells it all. It's not edited or approved by a PR agent. Just Harry in his own words. There are funny parts and you realize he was just a normal boy. I absolutely love it and this one is staying in my home library. When my grandkids (who don't even exist at the moment) get fed lies about the British Royal Family in the papers, I will pull out this book. Great read! He's such a humble guy, too."

atronetti,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An In-Depth Memoir of a Boy's Trauma and Heartbreak, and his Growth into a Man","Forget the media's pronouncements about the book.  It is a heart wrenching life story of a boy traumatized by his mother's death.  As a mother (about the same age as Diana, and with two sons), his stories about misconduct and experimentation reflect today's reality.  Most kids go through this.  But for most, it is not a State Issue, covered by the press, and known by everyone you will meet throughout the rest of your life.Prince Harry takes us through the stages of his grief and trauma, and how it impacted him throughout his life.  He shows how PTSD cares little for royal titles and privilege.  His gut-wrenching description of anxiety attacks, if anything, understates the paralysis and physical pain.  Reading about how he still tried to give speeches, during an attack, makes you appreciate his courage.  He doesn't ask for appreciation, though.  He tells the story self-deprecatingly, not asking for your sympathy.  There are juicy tidbits to keep the reader's attention, but it's deeper meaning is not lost.Importantly, Prince Harry takes us through the journey from teenager to soldier.  We are given us a unique insight into what nations ask their young people to do, on the state's behalf.  Prince Harry describes the hundreds of hours of training, the transport into a war zone, the boredom broken up by life threatening attacks, and the difficult return home.  Home, where his service is ignored for reminding tabloid readers about his youthful indiscretions.Finally, we get to see that the monarchy  needs learn that racial injustice is everywhere, and everyone needs to do their part to overcome it.  He shows the reader that the treatment of Meghan was NOT the same as other royals.  The nastiness included a glaring and obvious racial component.  Prince Harry educates the reader that racial insensitivity, and injustice, didn't just hurt HER, it hurts EVERYONE.  It keeps the stereotypes alive and in circulation.  Kudos to Prince Harry for recognizing his own insensitivity, and now taking the time to educate others.Prince Harry takes the blame for his own failings, but refuses to take the blame for everyone's failings.  He describes how the Palace, through its backdoor dealings with the media, created a narrative about him, which he was forbidden to correct.  The reader appreciates the delicate balance that tries to keep the monarchy relevant, protecting the heir at all costs, including the costs to the ""Family.""  His is a story about a boy that wants a Family, and an Institution that cannot be ""just a family.""  While he understands the media will create its own narrative, he gives the reader his blemished life ... his side ... without interruption.This book is well worth the read.  You won't regret it."
Nicole,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the most powerful memoirs I've read in a long time.,"This book is not what the tabloids wanted to be able to criticize. It provides context for the wildly out of context things the media puts forward. It gives grace to his family for a lot of their friction, showing an understanding of how complex different backgrounds and cultures are, and it unpacks a lot of stuff that is far overdue to be unpacked within his family (I will criticize him for still believing that monarchy can work - he still needs to unpack how monarchy is inherently dated and problematic and it's not just his family's differences.) It shows a side to him that he hasn't been able to show. He's allowed to be a primary source for one of the first times ever. It's clear how much he loves his wife and how much he loves his children.It's also clear that the most fundamental part of him is how much he loves his mother, how much he misses her, and how much her loss and the circumstances surrounding it traumatized him. Harry is a very privileged man in many ways. But you can be privileged in some ways and a victim in others. He is certainly both. If one looked at the constant formality, the coldness, the lack of physical affection within his family, how he was taught to never cry, never have deep conversations, never be anything but exactly what he was supposed to be, and placed that same scenario within a poor, underprivileged family, we'd all see it for what it was. Neglect, abuse, toxicity. That part of it doesn't go away because he's rich. As I read this I thought back to my childhood and how, while I didn't understand so much of how awful it can be to be famous, I did always know one thing (perhaps due to a children's book about Diana that I found in my elementary school library a couple years after she died): that I did not want to be famous. That I want to blend in. And if I'd not even had that choice, I don't know that I'd be alive today.This is a deeply traumatized person in many ways, including being taken advantage of by others for money and their own fame his entire life. He's taking back the power now, and while he's still a work in progress (see his opinions on the concept of monarchy) he's done a lot of work and he's determined to break that cycle.And in case this isn't already clear - I believe every word he says."
Hannah Somers,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An astounding, beautifully written book","Almost dickensian in places  (the abuse, the bullying!), this book would be one of the best of the year, even if it had been fiction, with the events only a cautionary tale, instead of terribly real. It's a gorgeous and deep book, full of Harry's wit, bravery, and compassion. It is an unsparing look at himself and the royal family. Near the beginning of the book, I was crying with laughter. Later in the book, I cried from sadness. This is an important book, for many reasons. People suffering from trauma can be helped with this book. This book is indispensable as a source when discussing the future of the monarchy in Britain. This book shows how much British laws need to change to address stalking, harassing and libeling public figures. Mostly, though, it is, as most inspirational books are, a book about the power of love to overcome overwhelming obstacles. Terrific book."
Kiki May,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry ❤️,"It's 2:30 am, I had to pause reading for a second because I needed to just breathe. I lack the eloquence or linguistic ability to leave a review that could adequately express the emotions that I felt reading this book. For me it speaks to the traumas that I've experienced in my own life. There are moments of pain, of doubt, there are questions, there's confusion, there's anger. But as time progresses there's just a simple desire to move on from it all and create a life of peace and joy and acceptance. Reading this book has brought all those stages of my trauma to mind and as such has created so much sympathy for Harry, someone, despite his status, who is just another human being. Read it, whether you agree, sympathize, or not, it's occasionally quite humorous and  pretty enjoyable, unless you're a cynic in which case just keep moving."
SUMANA SHASHIDHAR,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Vulnerable, honest and touching","This is a story of trauma, family dysfunction, love, loss and hope.I came away feeling sympathy for all the people in this - the monarchy that is a family forced to function as an institution, rather than being seen as actual people, with very little actual freedom in the day-to-day small choices that the rest of us commoners have; the culture of a stiff upper lip that does not allow for the emotional engagement that grieving children and adults need or are trained to give or receive; and the personal bravery needed to step away from everything one knows, knowing fully well that something is lost in the journey of gaining something equally important- and coming to terms with it.Families and relationships can be incredibly dysfunctional, even when there is a profound underlying love, as Harry so eloquently outlines in this book. I am touched by his hope that a reconciliation is possible down the road, and if all the folks involved can set aside their egos, the stories in their head about the events and examine their own words/actions or lack of it that contributed to the issues, it is possible. However, to look at oneself critically and be willing to admit to what is lacking or wrong is so hard. That Harry is on the path to doing this for himself speaks to how he is evolving as a person. There is a lesson in this for the coming generation of monarchy as well, with brothers and sisters who might well have to contend with the emotions of being related to a sibling who will one day be the king or queen, and face the same challenges.Ultimately it is a thoughtful story of a man who talks about how events, people, and relationships in his life have shaped him, the love that he feels for each and everyone of them, and how mindfully he is choosing to navigate and live life - to stand up for what feels right and stand up to what feels morally, ethically and humanly wrong. I applaud him for it."

This just feels like a letter of truth to his family, and we get to read it.  Worth every penny.  This is not ""more of the same"", not even close.  It's funny, he really exposed the human side of the royal family, they've got to be reeling after this.  It was just these simple, specific, details, I just kept thinking,  ok so here's the truth.  Funny, so much revealed about his family, yet it never felt scathing, did not feel like an attack, just......his truth.  Basically every awful thing the British press has written about him over the years, he simply and succinctly addresses them all.

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding…,"Well written insight into the life and struggles of Prince Harry. I’ve read many comments about the irrelevance and traitorous things written. Simply, it’s a man’s story about the abuse and trauma he experienced through out his life. The more exploited excerpts were completely taken out of context or not as relevant as other important topics he touches on. Overall, there is a blatant sense of emotional neglect as a child which follows him into his adulthood. The persistent sense of the media tirelessly hounding him- even as a child. The worst is the complete dehumanization of himself and his wife- the dangers of propaganda. There is this angst and betrayal (not on Prince Harry’s part.) It begs to ask the question- who in their right mind would choose to go back to that life?  Just reading some of his experiences left me with a visceral sense of anxiety and dread."
Mrs B.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well written,"Out of interest purchased Harry’s book for my mum to read, and bought myself it on the kindle. We have both agreed; his mum Diana adored her boys. And we were sad to read how his family seem to have learnt nothing from her, or her death. Although mixed opinions and feelings due to how over privileged they all are. The book certainly gives away the deep thoughts Harry felt from a young age, and how the death of his mother truly affected him though his life. Where I first thought this might be a book to damage the royals in some way on his part. Looking at the whole picture it seems that he just wants to have his proper say,  and explain how it was, how it is now, and how much better things should be, but aren’t. The book feels written from the heart, eye opening moments. Lots of boring pages as well. But seems necessary to get the proper idea of his life, as it’s not meant to be fiction."
Tracy P,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His story deserves to be heard,"I know his writing is controversial, spilling so many secrets of the running of the monarchy. I understand why the family is so guarded in order to protect the monarchy, its their full existence. He deserves the support to be happy and not just a body standing to the side and not getting the opportunity to really live.I don't blame him for wanting to get the full picture out, to not want to be the bad guys.I do believe he will see as he ages, that what everyone else thinks, doesn't matter and that although I enjoyed reading it, he didn't have to set the record straight.On the other hand, what options was he given to support his family and keep them protected?He had to secure an income somehow and this was obviously the quickest and most lucrative way of doing so.It was a good book. I absolutely love his personality, both deep and mischievous. He's an all around great man and his mother would be incredibly proud."

We got to hear, for the first time, the perspective of a Royal. Reading this story was a journey with many ups and downs. It felt like he was right in front of me, just having a casual conversation. like listening to a friend share stories about their life. From growing up at the palace to going to war in Afghanistan. Harry has lived a very unique life. But at the base of it all, it seems all he really wants is to be of service and to help this world. Despite what gets said about him in the media, he still forges on this path. If we can take anything from this book, it should be that there aren't many in the world with his unique position and public fascination, and if he can create so much good from his platform, then who are we to stand in his way? I for one, can't wait to see what he does next, I know it will be transformative. Great book Harry! Keep on speaking and living your truth!"
Ida,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,GUT-WRENCHING!!,"I’ve been a fan of The Royal Family since Princess Diana came onto the global stage. I mourned incessantly when she died, and rejoiced when her boys got married, especially William. I watched those boys grow up. Therefore, I purchased this long-awaited book on its first day of publication. To say that reading this story brought tears to my eyes, would be an understatement. I have lost all of my respect for William and Kate. (I never had much for Charles to begin with). In my humble opinion, when he cried out to his father and brother to be heard, and he was repeatedly silenced, I don’t believe that he had any other alternative than what he did. There are countless examples of the way he was treated, but the title of this book sums it up in that small 5 letter word. Bravo, Harry, for unlocking this archaic institution for what it really is!!"
StarWars,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"omg, just buy this already. It. Is. Superb.","So much in this book to like. It's ridiculous, how not only is he treated like a spare heir, but like a less worthy child and brother and human by his family. Who knew his only money was from his dad who controls the purse strings? That he and Meghan had IKEA furniture? That he was given an underground shabby apartment? He needs permission to shave his beard? So many headlines that sounded legit, are shattered here. Even those who never believed negative headlines, will be blown away and this will reframe your thinking about any gossipy headline you read, about anyone at all. Even the skinny dip in the Vegas pool is explained. Crazy, that they're not ""allowed"" to publicly defend themselves. Even the American press is horrible - the excerpts they glamorized, like his frozen ""todger"" when there's so much more in the book than that. Great read, worthy of much discussion."

It doesn't matter if you are poor, rich or royalty, no one should ever turn a blind eye to lies being written or told about them.

Rebecca Nielsen,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t listen to the naysayers!,"I went in with an open mind and made my own decisions and opinions. I laughed (his poor frost nipped todger!), I cried tears of sadness (“I’m afraid she didn’t made it, dear boy.”), tears of joy (his description of Lilibet’s birth!). But most of all- Harry’s raw candor and vulnerability (“Pa? Wills? World? Here you go.”) made a Prince relatable to a middle class woman from the USA. We all bleed red (not blue, eh Haz?), we all love, lose, grieve, fear, cry, and laugh. But what not everyone can do is look at ourselves and our life experiences objectively and honestly, and not only share it with the world, but go head-to-head with all of it. The good, bad, and the ugly.  Bravo and many thanks to you Harry- aka Harold, Darling Boy, H, Spike, Haz- and indescribably so much more than The Spare."
Rosalie Haas,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Read,"I had no plans to read Harry's book, not because of him but because I've never cared for his wife. Then I saw him on Stephen Colbert, and he was charming, witty, funny! In other interviews he was so serious, but with Colbert he seemed so relaxed and able to have some fun with it. So .... I bought the book.I believe every word. I have been critical of this couple claiming to want privacy as they continue with interviews. This is a man who has essentially been told all of his life to just keep his mouth shut. I can understand now why it is necessary for him to finally speak his whole truth, and I am glad that he feels he now can. Shame on the press and shame on the entire monarchy for aiding and abetting this enemy.Harry has created a loving family of his own. I hope he recognizes the power in that."
Stephanie Linden,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A absolute must read!,"Confirmed everything I suspected and more. I remember Princess Diana's funeral. I was the same age as Harry. I recall seeing them smile as they greeted guests and I though, how strange. Their mum just died and here they are smiling.Spare takes you through his life, his pain, his grief, and his journey into claiming a hope, peace, and grace he never thought possible and a life his mother only dreamed of.Yes, it gives you a view behind the royal purple curtain.  Yes, there are secrets. Yes, it confirms what most people suspected; the press, the palace, and it's new King and Queen care about themselves. They care very little who is hurt in their climb to high approval numbers.It's a sad but true story and I, for one, am glad they made it out.Couldn't put this book down.Harry, i have no doubts that your mum would be immensely and immeasurably proud of the man you've become."
Leisha Mareth,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I see his side…,"The most decisive thing I can say about his book is that he convinced me that I was heavily swayed by the press before reading it.  I was enamored with William and Kate and annoyed with Harry and Meghan.  He made a solid case for his side (although it’s mainly his memoir, only touching briefly on the present.) I get it now.  I don’t agree with everything he’s done, but I can understand and empathize with his viewpoint far more than I could before.  Of course we will never hear the other side.  But as someone who went through therapy and learned tools for healthier living, sometimes it alienates you from friends or family who don’t want to evolve.  I wish him well in creating a healthy family for himself."
TimeAlone,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I Read This,"I'm glad I read this book, enabling readers to see the exploitation and robotic mannerisms of the Royal family. Tradition, not parental love, was the mainstay behind this family; ruining many lives. Some have said Harry was whining. I did not for one moment see it that way, only an explanation to help lead up to the final truth. Stiff upper lips and allowance of the press to destroy were maintained for too long and along came a breathe of fresh air; destined to be. It took a lot of courage for Harry and Meghan to escape and while it will always be hurtful for them to be estranged; they did what they had to do for their family. You can only admire that. They're a part of the British history that will go down into history and possibly make a change for the better. Slowly."
Christa Southworth,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,poignant and wrenching,"This was truly a wonderful book. I found his tone to be both reverential and a bit cheeky, much like he has been described by his friends. He humanized both his grandmother and his father and painted a strong portrait of the complicated relationship between siblings. Throughout, he conveyed a clear picture of the true enemy, the British Press, while conveying a deep and abiding love for his fellow countrymen and women. I could really feel and understand his torment as he tried so desperately to protect his wife and children while discovering that other family had used them as bait and fodder. There is something distinctly crushing about familial betrayal but it is far worse when that betrayal is aimed at the people you love most in the world. I wish him and his little American family the best and hope they can overcome the harm that was purposefully done to them."
Julie E.,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Three sides to every story,"The old phrase seems fitting and true. Prince Harry shares a remarkably honest accounting of his life and relationships from his perspective... Which is all that anyone has.  I have read many biographies and I would put Spare among the best.  I found the style of writing compelling.  It made reading even the darkest stories comforting.If you take moments to reflect while reading the book, it will open your view to the world wide need to question the media and the personal responsibility not to be an audience.  It made me recognize the complicit nature of falling into click bait.  Not  just for the royals, but for all the subjects that are prey for profits.I applaud Harry for writing this book, but more for taking the difficult and dangerous path to a more peaceful life for his family."
caroline davis,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written and heartbreaking and truthful,"I don’t know if Harry reads reviews but it is so awesome to see truth about grief. I was only 17 when my father was killed by a drunk driver and grief sucks, it is forever and you never get over it. I started this book on the eve of the anniversary of my father’s death. It was perfect to hear his feelings and struggles.Of course me being American I have only been exposed to royalty via Disney and not how crazy the paps and gossip mags. I just love Harry and I am glad he is found Megan and started a journey here in the states. If I ever saw him I would give him a huge hug. This book is well written and perfect. If I ever went to England I would want to see his grandmother and not his father. Harry is not a spare….he is his mother’s child and always a prince in my book."
Huguette Westlake,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Truth will set you free. And it did.,I chose that book because of the injustice and lies of the press and common people who judge without knowing. I always believed in Harry and Meghan’s love for each other and their children and also I cannot imagine the hurt they suffered because of their siblings and family. Then I realize they rose as phoenix out of the ashes of live and loveless family and made their own way. I am happy that they are achieving financial independence and are doing it their way. They deserve every bit of joy coming their way and I admire the courage it took to break away from the firm to find their truth and live their purpose driven life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting to the truth and believe me the truth does not come from the Palace and their residents. Follow the money.
Pamela L. Smith,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!,"I even teared up reading about the first time he took Meghan to visit his mother’s grave at Althorp.I’ve seen the vile and repulsive hatred and racism on social media. Sadly it’s in some of the 1 star reviews of this book. Clearly from people who either didn’t read the book or if they did, failed to comprehend what they were reading.Harry and Meghan are clearly very much in love. And I do believe his family has love for them. They are just so entrenched in the dysfunction that is the royal family that I truly believe it when they say they don’t understand why Harry and Meghan left. Hopefully some day they will understand and they can all heal. Harry seems to be the most enlightened one in the bunch, who recognizes his flaws and wants to be better.I wish only continued happiness for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."
Salliano,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great to hear Harry's story from himself.,"I love to read autobiographies and never read the daily crap rags. Was a refreshing read. It must have been good therapy for Harry to start from the beginning of the tormented life he lead after the death of his mother, Lady Diana. Watching her being stalked by the paps who fed, clothed and put their children  through private schooling off of the back of Diana and her boys. When the paps killed her with their chasing and stalking, they then turned on her boys. Crazy why the UK press did not nuture them and show some loyalty to the hand that feeds them. People would buy happy stories, just look at how many people read happy books.Luckily, Harry met Meghan and his life turned around. Well, as we know, our press hounded them and were vile. The institute would not help and did not support.. because he was not William and Kate. Ironic when Will is known for his support around mental health but happy to let your little brother sink and have no sense of belonging. The irony.Anyway, the book ends on a high and I was sad it ended.I felt proud that this guy opened up and spoke about his feelings and his mind. Harry has openly talked about this on tv. This helps others feel that it is okay to say that you are not okay. Help is out there. A therapist helped Harry and they help others too.I look forward to the next book if there is one. Hopefully about their work together (Harry and Meghan) raising awareness about our planet. Finding peace by talking.This book certainly does not disappoint."
Lucia Villaveces,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Prince Harry is a born writer that captivates his readers. He is so sensitive, so honest, so caring that it is very easy to love him as soon as you start reading his story. He touched my heart and made me cry many times, but also smile at his spontaneous sense of humour and outforwardness!I recommend Spare because it also shows how lies and deceit are much more harmful and prevailing in today’s world than the pandemic we all had to live such a short time ago!Harry, you don’t need to find a way to make your living! Keep on writing and you will surely be a well known writer! you have what it takes! And I am sooo happy that you found Meg , such a beautiful soul  and you had two lovely children . That is all you need to be really happy!"
Janice W Berry,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much more than a Spare,"Thanks so much for putting it in writing.  Especially since it can't be altered or skewed this time.It was always obvious that there was so much more happening and we know that the tabloids are famous for creative writing here in the states.  It just never occurred to me that so much garbage would be put out by the Monarchy to destroy one and promote the other.  That is just so destructive to a family.  After a while, it's difficult for the family to recover.I totally get the - you're golden when you're dead - what good does that do you or your relationship with the family?Y'all totally did the right thing in protecting yourselves, your family and your relationship.  I've been there.  It's not easy, but it's so worth it.  Have a wonders filled life!"
butlerbkoolmom,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read/Even better audio,"I got the kindle version with the accompanying audio (read by Prince Harry) and loved it.He really reveals some intimate things and tells a compelling story.  I think he has every right to be aggrieved at his family.  The paparazzi (encompassing both the newsprint and photo journalist types) are out of control and should not be allowed to get away with their slanderous and malicious ways.  But King Charles does have a point, “Don’t read it, dear Boy.”I hope Harry is able to prevail in his fight to change the way the media treat public figures and the horribly damaging way the royal family deals with life.And he keeps his family safe.ps: can’t say enough about the audio to accompany the kindle read. The Prince does an awesome job of narrating!"
Greta,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A beautifully written, heartfelt memoir","Spare is a beautifully written, honest, and heartfelt memoir.  The collaboration between Prince Harry and J.P. Moehringer is a great success.  Harry's voice - as heard on recent interviews - comes through effectively in this book, which reads as though Harry is speaking directly to us.I applaud Harry for speaking out and telling his story.  I hope that he and Meghan are able to turn the page now, raise their family in peace, and go on to make a positive difference by helping others with causes that are important to them.  I hope that the British Royal Family will also turn a page by speaking out against racism and the ignoble relationship between Palace courtiers and the British tabloid press.Family relationships are sometimes difficult.  Reading about Harry and William has helped me in some ways to better understand my relationship with my younger brother."
Mary L,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thrilled that you have found true happiness!!,"This book exceeded my expectations. It was raw, honest, disappointing ( in the RF) but not surprising, at times funny, sad, and an almost happy ending. I wish his relationships were better with Willian and King Charles but it takes them both to make a better one not just Harry. I am extremely happy that Archie and Lilibet will be raised in a loving home full of hugs, kisses, family time and all the wonderful things that Harry and Megan are allowed to do here in the US which Harry never had and  would have been prohibited in the RF. The chain has been broken and now the generations of Wales ( H&M),  to come will have better relationships with their children and siblings.  Good for you Harry, Good for you."
AlGor54,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poignant and honest,"Why are critics being so down on this book? There seems to be a concerted effort to destroy this young man and his bride. Rumours abound about what happened to his wife and why is she hiding, or, is their marriage on the skids. Why is he so negative about his family, and why and why… he used a ghost writer and so it’s not his words and Yadda Yadda… I’m old, have seen the royals play out their drama for years and years, and I’m not a fan. But, this young man stuck his neck out to give us just a glimpse of his short life and his highly dysfunctional family and offers us what I think is an honest and touching tale that has moved me and a few others. If you’re not a fan of the royals, as I’m not, still, this story is worth reading. I give it five stars. (Revised)"
TJBEACHES,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting journey of a Royal,"I was intrigued to read a true account of what it is like to grow up as a modern day member of the Royal family. One can only imagine what it is like behind what is represented to the public. Now I know. This book had to be written under the circumstances of constant lies and obsessive trashing from the press. Now there is a documented truthful account for history. It’s just horrendous the amount of lies that Harry has had to deal with his entire life. That in itself is traumatizing. He was always a bit of a rebel, and now we can know why.  The ghost writer could have been a bit better, but overall it is a great read.  I wish Harry and Meghan all the luck and resolve going on in their life. They should do the charities they love and ignore London for a few years. In time, it will all work out. I hope the Royals will get some backbone and change for the better. Love and understanding is much better than hate and judgement."
Favored Ann,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read. The. Book.,"For decades the press has made millions and billions of dollars off of Prince Harry and his family. More often they are writing out right lies that have shaped how the public views and treats the royals family. Specifically Harry and his wife. He has been able to finally have his own words and his own narrative out there. Dozens of books have been written about him in the last decade, it’s about time HIS words were added to the mix. Prince Harry isn’t perfect, far from it and he acknowledges that. If many people who can write books who never have met PH and claim their work as fact I see no reason why Harry can’t himself.The book was a good memoir and I’m thankful his words are now out there."
Amazon Customer JAC,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely great read!,This book delivers.  Ignore all the negative press about it.  I wanted to know what royal life is like and hear the truth from the source.  It delivered.  Lots of famous people put out autobiographies and no one says they are just doing it for the money so keep that in mind.  Harry has to work like the rest of us.  This is a well written book answering questions I had for years.  I loved his mum and now I can relate to what she and her sons went thru/are going thru.  Read this with an open mind like you would any other biography.  I wanted to hear about his life experiences from him. That’s why I bought the book.  Highly recommend!  Great book.
griffinlover,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good read!,"Harry wrote about substantial life events that I don’t feel qualified to fully critique as a reader, but I appreciate his brutal honesty and openness. It’s at times, gut wrenching but he was also quite funny too. The part that hurt the most was him believing his mum was just hiding. I just don’t think it’s fair for me to say what I would do, or what he should have done, but rather to just state what I perceived his main points were.That being said, my top takeaway is that Spare is, first and foremost, a story of trauma, grief that went untreated for many years, and familial dysfunction, media abuse and slander that continues to this day. This book had opened my eye and I have a huge soft spot for H&M and I wish this young family a bright, happy and safe future."
An avid reader,Reviewed in Germany on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshingly honest,"Some of the information was quite shocking for me - for instance, the fact that regardless of their young age, neither of the two princes received any kind of professional psychological support in the wake of the sudden and horrific loss of their mother. I can totally understand how that alone would mark someone for life and a lot of things described in this autobiography reveal how Harry was and still is wounded for he's never had a chance to fully heal. The trolls writing cruel and abuseve reviews here are a testimony to one of the reasons for this."
starsandstarz8989,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A deeply moving account of his life,"Spare is an honest, detailed and thoughtful account of Prince Harry’s life. It starts after the break in his childhood—the death of his beloved mother, Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales. We learn about his growth journey, his mistakes, his pains and his joys. Most importantly, by the end of this memoir, we see the gaping contrast between the paths of the brothers as they live in their individual parents’ legacies. Harry has proudly picked up the torch of Diana’s legacy and has sprinted away from the dysfunctional system that is the royal family, the gilded cage as she called it  He dispels tabloid myths that he and William had ever been close. He sheds light on the nastiness he and his new wife faced at the hands of the royal family and their closet partners—the British tabloids. He faces them all head on, laying the truth bare. His mental health journey is one we can admire as, unlike the performance of mental health advocacy we often see with William and Catherine, Harry’s advocacy is rooted in the work he’s done on himself—to save himself. Deliberate growth from trauma is a choice. For Harry that growth was a necessary step into a portal that divided what’s false and what’s true. I’d recommend Spare to anyone who’s on a self-discovery journey of their own. Prince Harry is his own man and this is his story."
Helen A. Gordon,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,He is his mother’s son,"Better, more emotional and moving than the television series. You get to experience the soul of this young and broken-hearted man. He tells the truth of his dysfunctional family, his mental and anxiety issues and never backs away from admitting his youthful mistakes.It is heartbreaking that his father and brother could not secure his safety and find a place in the Queen’s mission for Harry and Meghan to continue their work. I admire Harry and Meghan for speaking out and stating their truth. Good for Harry that he is protecting his family and living his own life. His mother is proud but more importantly, Harry and Meghan are their own people, designing their own lives. I hope you are proud of yourselves, you have been unfairly judged. Maybe in time, you will find some measure of peace with your family. No matter, well done Harry."
maj,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thankful to know the truth,"I’m an editor who finds a good read maybe once a year or so. I couldn’t put this book down. Reminded me of Ernest Hemingway’s style of writing.With all my doubts about the couple before I started reading the book, I definitely changed my opinion of them after reading it. Loved Harry’s candidness and vulnerability and continued love of family while suffering from his mother’s death, military PTSD, and living in the royal maelstrom and press attacks/prosecution. I truly believe we get what we give and that positive energy will bring positive karma and outcomes. Harry finally is getting back what he gave with a beautiful wife and family. I believe your mother and granny are looking down on you and beaming with happiness and love for your incredible strength and bravery."
DisneyDenizen,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS BOOK DELIVERS,"I know what you're thinking. After...- the Oprah interview- the six-hour Netflix tell-all documentary- the 60-minutes interview- that other long interviewDoes Prince Harry really have anything more to say?The answer is a most emphatic: YES!I wanted two things from this book:First, I wanted to get a real glimpse behind the curtain at how the Royal Family operates from someone who has lived it.Second, I wondered whether Prince Harry would actually share real details about his life or just skim the surface, particularly since he is both British and a member of the royal family.Prince Harry delivers. Boy, does he deliver. He offers us real insights into a life lived behind that curtain. And, if anything, he overshares the details of his life. Frostbite, anyone? lol But all joking aside, the frostbite anecdote in and of itself is proof positive that Prince Harry bares all in this book, so I'm glad he included it. In that sense, the anecdote is very revealing.How dreadful it must be to spend your entire life as the Heir waiting for a job you were born into to materialize only when your parent dies and perhaps only when you are at retirement age. How much worse must it be to be the Spare, waiting in the wings for a role which will likely never come, understudy to The Crown.Prince Harry and Meghan didn't just live life in that horrifying institution; they escaped from it. And good for them.Somewhere, Princess Diana is proud, so proud."
Karen G,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Detailed and heartrending account of palace life and those who control it,"Despite the pundits, ""Spare"" is engrossing, and not just for the ""what-happened-behind-the-curtains"" aspect, but for its transparency, alacrity and perspective.  I debated adding to the Harry and Meghan Montecito fund, but have not been able to put the book down since opening it tonight. Harry writes conversationally and casually, in a stream of consciousness way. Quite a lot is about his time in the military, which he says ""saved him"", and, contrary to rumors, he doesn't bash anybody, but is hardest on his brother, with whom he has yet to reconcile. By the way, ""spare"" is also a British colloquialism for the word ""angry"", and Harry reserves most of that for the British press.  Harry goes into detail about his anxiety, his self-medicating, the ""gray men"" Diana spoke about and the power they wield, and the attempts he's made to reconnect with his family.  A sad, but good read."
Deborah Farinha,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read!,"What a great read.  For all his failures and for all the judgement of Harry over the last few years, I am definitely one who condemned him but I am now squarely sitting on the fence, he has redeemed himself somewhat in my eyes.  The book is an autobiography (a very good one) like most any other person would write, starting with his mother’s death it is a great and pretty detailed account of his life.Very interesting stories of growing up within the family, his years at Eton, his mistakes, his various girlfriends, his gap year at an Australian ranch where he worked with the earth and the cattle. Lesotho where he worked to help children with AIDS.  The African bush is his heart, the Okavango delta and all the animals, what interesting tales he has to tell!  The  Army training, threats, failures, successes, helicopter training, tears, disappointments, travelling, the North Pole, the South Pole and so much more. There’s lots of sibling rivalry which could be somewhat “normal”, talk of the family and the press growing up, his handlers, trainers, bodyguards, etc. etc.The first 65% of the book is about his early life, Meghan is not mentioned until page 267 of 410, and this is where he starts to get into details about the family and the Institution.  I think everyone needs to read it themselves to form their own opinion about this chapter of his life.  It is, at the very least, good insight into what it is to be constantly in the limelight, hounded by the press at every turn, and to be part of the Institution. Yes, there may have been some over-sharing, and some might be a bit self-indulgent, but, I get it.I was expecting a book of whinging and blame, passing the buck, but that’s not what I got at all.  Enjoyed it.  I used to really love Harry, he got a little piece of my heart back.  I highly recommend it especially if you like to read.  At the very least, it’s a great read."

My husband's father died when my husband was 11 years old and I can definitely relate to Harry's efforts to cope as I've known my husband since his 22nd birthdayI liked hearing the thoughts of an intelligent but not studious person and gained a genuinely new perspective because I am studious and maybe should be a lot less judgy than I haveI do think Megan is adorable and personally identify with her struggles with her  awful father and half siblingsSo.

Teresi,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A insightful, truthful view","Prince Harry does not disparage his parent nor his brother. He looks at HIS life from HIS perspective, and HIS needs from the family he was dealt.It is refreshing to.meet a ""true man"" in the "" Royals"".  He is unafraid to look at rules, unwritten regulations, protecales, from HIS point of view, and find that they are truly lacking in humane value. Particularly where untrue press is concerned.Those individuals and their agents should be brought to task at all times! It is indeed  sad to see His Brother and Father valuing Royal protecals over Brotherhood, caring, respect, and loving family interaction.For in the end all Harry and Megan are asking for is love, privacy, respect and honor.

Maureen Deskins,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally candid,"What comes through is Harry's clear effort to be totally truthful about his life.  He comes across as flawed, charming, funny, intelligent and oh so human.  None of us can imagine the pressure of living a life under his circumstances with the constant lenses of a 1,000 photographers watching his every move.  What a terrible existence for anyone.  I applaud his efforts to use his position to do good in the world and to save his family from a life of skewed scrutiny and reckless invasion.  I hope America provides him and his family with the peace they deserve.  This book sets the record straight and is a treasure chest of insightful if not painful stories from a guy just trying to live his best life.  Well done Harry."
Roadscholar,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sensitive, Intelligent and very Insightful!",Where do I begin? This book is very well written. And gives a detailed description of the crazy world we live in. Through the eyes and heart of Prince Harry. There is so much humanity in Harry’s voice that I could not not identify with him! His experiences are simply being magnified because of his royal inheritance. His terribly dysfunctional family hopelessly stuck within an archaic system which has no place in our present society. Yet there is a whole entire team of twisted souls doing everything they can to make it last and last some more. For the sake of getting more money and more power still.Harry couldn’t play the game. He tried. Meghan did too. But it soon started to attack their very own sanity. So there was only one obvious way out. I am so glad they flew away. Far away. To start a new life. To live out their beautiful love story.By them choosing to tell their truth - to tell the truth - they are elevating the consciousness of our society as a whole. At the exception of the ones who still prefer to trust the likes of the tabloids of course.Murky waters versus bright sunlight.A no brainer IMO!
Word Junckie,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Context, finally, in honest and sometime poetic detail","I read Prince Harry’s Spare eager to learn about his life from him, in his own words, and the book does not disappoint. How leaks of book excerpts were spun—taken hugely out of context and sensationalized, especially by the British press—proved a point made throughout the book and underscored exactly why Prince Harry needed to write Spare in the first place, and I applaud him! I especially enjoyed the easy going style of the book—an intimate, honest read that is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into a family and institution with an enduring history that is part of our own history—the good, bad and the ugly. Regarding media coverage of the book, I am baffled that even after the revelations in the book and the preceding Netflix series about the Palace’s various PR machines, many journalists and television personalities naively continue to say that “the Palace has made no comment.” The Palace’s campaign to damn the book and salvage The Firm’s image is obvious in the timing and framing of the barrage of negative coverage of Spare, carefully juxtaposed to the manicured appearances of the remaining working Royal Family. Make no mistake that this was a full-on PR assault by The Firm with others doing the dirty work so the working Royal Family can continue to claim allegiance to the stiff-upper-lip, “never complain, never explain” practice apparently so valued in British culture. I enjoyed the book so much that I am rereading it, and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates an intimate autobiography and a pull-back of the curtain on an enduring institution. At its roots Spare is a story about a person of privilege who has done and continues to do the hard work to gain a more realistic and enlightened view of our diverse world, a deeper understanding of self, and to forge a path from pain to purpose. We can all learn from his journey."
Purchaser,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written, completely honest, self-aware, thoughtful, an AMAZING read!","Dear Harry, I LOVED this.  I've been an English teacher for 27 years and must say that this is a beautifully written novel.  I'd have enjoyed it no matter what, but it was so meaningful because it was you, who I've admired and wanted to know more about for several years.  It made me cry a few times, but it also made me laugh out loud often, especially the antics at your school as a child (reminded me of Dickens). Thank you for sharing this with the world.  No matter how many people there are that seem to want to distort everything you say and do, just know that there are many more that think you and Meghan are absolutely wonderful, truly.  I look forward to reading this again!"
Ashley Madera,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Enjoyable Read… Enlightening even,"Surprising, and yet, not so… Prince Haz is an excellent and eloquent writer. It’s as if we know him from the first sentence. He is vulnerable and transparent in this autobiography. The stories you want to know and have yet to be made aware of the internal truths are all here in these pages. I was born on August 31 and turned 12 in 1997. A day that should have been celebrated was mourned instead and not one birthday has gone by since that I don’t think of our long-lost Lady and her sons. As a kindred spirit I am grateful for the insight that this memoir provides. Grab some tea, coffee, or red wine and get ready for a front row seat to an intimate journey with the prince told from his own point of view. Highly enjoyable and highly recommend."
Lee,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting,"Well, it took me nine days to devour this book, but it was a riveting read. I found it to be poignant yet hopeful but, above all else, brutally honest. Whatever you've heard, know that it was never about a rift with the family alone but about the revolting relationship the thrown shares with the press [a constant antagonist throughout the entire biography]. Whatever side you've taken based on the coverage we've been fed on the Sussexes, I think it essential to read HIS TRUTH to form an unbiased opinion. For any of us who have spoken or thought ill of this man throughout the years based on stories we've read, we owe him that much. In the end, it may not sway your opinion, but you WILL question everything you thought you ever knew on the subject of royalty."
Sherry Wendel,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,No More a Spare,"This story explained so many things that anyone could see. It's A sad state that Harry and Megan no longer have the support of the royal family and obviously never really did. His mental health issues were conveniently overlooked and ignored. Megan herself had very serious mental health issues that were also overlooked and ignored just as she was by her ""new family"". God bless them both to keep their strength and love of each other and their children. May He bless them with sanity and continuing love in His love for them. Hopefully one day Harry's family will wake up and discover the emptiness in their hearts and welcome Harry and his new family back into the folds. Family should be first! Thank you for the words you have written to shed light on the missing parts in your life."
Alexis,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A surprisingly insightful memoir,"I always thought that the vitriol from the British media seemed excessive for the couple, and there's a surprising number of ""experts"" selling their 2 cents about every minutia - are they a fly on the wall (boy, that's a lot of flies)? I mean don't these people have NDAs?Frankly, I never found Prince Harry smart but he seemed like a very empathetic person. The book reflects this personality trait, although it does read like a therapy session at times. Kudos to him and his ghostwriter for making a readable, hard-to-put-down book. He's right, context matters. I don't think he was divulging anything classified - a lot of the events have been reported in the tabloids repeatedly, so I don't get the brouhaha over offering his own version of what actually happened. As for the military operations, he doesn't state any particular campaign. I do appreciate him going into detail about it, and respecting his comrades enough not to divulge their stories.It reads like it came from a place of love and concern. I do wish he went more into detail about how the couturiers worked and the dynamic between the BRF and the Royal Rota worked but I guess that would be too dangerous and set off the entire establishment against them altogether. He also implies why he's doing this for his family. Their security costs must be astronomical. I don't blame him though. He found his own way to support and protect his family. That right there is a proper, real hero straight out of a classic fairy tale."
Jamelia85,Reviewed in Germany on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is well written, amazing story.","It’s one thing to read autobiographies written about Prince Harry, it’s great to read this book because the stories are directly from the horse’s mouth.To quote author Chinua Achebe,“Until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.”Well done Prince Harry.I highly recommend this book. Some of the stories in this book are stories some of us read in tabloids and newspapers. Reading it from Prince Harry in his own words makes a great difference, helps understand the background of some tabloid stories, viral photos like the infamous photo of his naked arse in Las Vegas.Many interesting stories in the book. Read it yourself, and judge after reading the book."
Private Reviewer Honest Feedback,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry was Hurt,"With excruciating detail Harry describes how his family hurt him deeply. It is refreshingly honest and genuine. The Royal Family and Britain may not like it, but sharing your truth is something that should never be shamed.Is it airing dirty laundry? I suppose some could say that but, how can there be healing or growth by remaining silent and keeping up appearances. Harry is on the right side of history.My largest takeaway away was that he and Meghan were abused. Used as doormats. When speaking up about their mistreatment they are freeing themselves. No longer shackled to imperialist ideology. Sometimes people should be questioned and exposed for their behavior. Don’t hide or be upset because someone is telling the truth. Recognize and accept that it is the truth and work together to repair the family.We all have struggled with our families. Family secrets are damaging. They harbor pain, lies and distance.I applaud Harry. A job well done!"
Kerri Lee Farrell,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Strong man,"I don't follow the royal family. I'm in the ""outdated institution"" camp. The first book actually put out by one of them, as opposed to about one of them, my curiosity was piqued. I found this book riveting.He outed himself as much as anyone else in the family so I don't think it was unfair. I believe him before any third party or, God forbid, the British press. I cannot understand why his family left him defenseless.  It takes a strong man to leave behind everything he knows and make his own way in the world, especially when he did it to protect his family.Easy to follow. He doesn't complain. He just explains. If you don't go in with a preconceived notion, you will enjoy this book."
Susan R. Bays,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Genuine Tale of Love and Forgiveness,"I was struck by the genuine portrayal of much of Harry's trauma and delayed processing of his mother's death. As a survivor of much childhood trauma, I recognized the delayed response as a survival skill that Harry described. I also understand how family dynamics, even for non-royals and private people, can be full of contradictions and Harry went to superhuman lengths to tell his story without being too harsh on his father or brother. Clearly, there are deep issues that may or may not ever get resolved, but at least in telling his story, Harry has laid out an open love letter of sorts to his family. I get the sense that he held back and for that, hopefully, history and his family will be kinder than they have been to Harry and his family."
Norma Rogers,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Write More Harry,"I hope Harry writes more books, turns out his inside voice is quite a good read. I think this is a very thought provoking book, very sobering. As a young adult (I was 13 when he was born), I watched his entire life. It's sobering and very impactful to realize how little true thought and genuine prayer I myself gave to the ACTUAL CHILD, the real human who grew up scrutinized and photographed without consent 24/7 merely by what we call now ""birth lottery"". I don't care what anyone says, the global media profited off him since conception, let him tell his story in his own words. This isn't a vindictive or retributive book, it's not a display of ingratitude, it's mostly therapeutic for him and I genuinely hope it helps him going forward."
susan unger,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you,"Thank you Harry, for such an honest and candid view into your world. A view none of us ever gets the opportunity to experience. Most of us only see privileged people,living in a gilded cage, but you have revealed a family with all of the  raw emotions and challenges,that few of us understand. You present all of this in sadness and love, a glimpse into your character. You accepted the challenge that was given to you, to set the record straight, in the face of a dishonest and lying press, on both sides of the Atlantic. You are an extraordinary young man, and I am grateful for your candid, but kind portrait of your family. I am happy that you are here with us on this side of the pond, and am grateful for you."
Woobie's Donna,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why is everyone so divided?,"He CLEARLY states in the forward...this is HIS story.  Don't like him, don't read it!  After reading it, I feel like..why all the attempts to shame him?  This is his perspective...his feelings....his journey.  The only reason for family, friends, the media to get their shorts in a bunch is that he finally got to tell HIS STORY without being edited, interrupted and talked over.  The man is entitled to his feelings and his emotions.  Royal family...get over yourselves.  Your a family first and foremost not a ""firm"".  Have your ""National Face""  but don't negate the needs and feelings of those who SHOULD BE your inner circle.  Honestly I applaud the bravery it took for Prince Harry to ""speak his truth"".  Hopefully this has been a healing journey for him and he can continue to grow and emerge in site of all the haters out there!!"
BJC,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry’s Story,"At the beginning of the story, I was unsure about what I was reading…the tale felt naive.  But that was exactly (I think) how Harry felt for many years after his mother’s death. Unguided, unprotected, and certainly not his family’s top priority.  That he managed to grow into the exceptionally aware man he is today, avoiding the koolaid that his family in England succumbed to, I am so amazed by him.  Harry’s real family are Meg and children, and all the mates he gathered along the way to stand by him.  Meg, I think you are amazing too for standing by Harry and surviving the ‘battle.’  Would that we all have this Spare’s strength of character and resolve for what is right."
AutumnMist,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Lion and the Hunter,"I finish the book in three days. I could not put it down. I found it to be beautifully written. Poignant, funny, heartbreaking, raw and at times infuriating. I believe Harry has told his full truth in this book, with compassion, self depreciation and love. And the way he described how he felt when he first laid eyes on Meghan was powerFul. The folks over at the castle are piece of work—Pa, Junior and their wives. They deserve each other. But I’m disappointed in the Brits. They should want better. Palace “sources?” Please.Well done Prince Harry. I am so glad you wrote your own story. As the African proverb says, “Until the lion learns to write, tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.” Well, this lion has spoken."
Aurelia Dante,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,FASCINATING AND VERY REVEALING,"This was always going to be a highly controversial book which would divide a lot of readers but it makes riveting reading and Harry comes across as a deeply sympathetic person.Of course! You might respond, this is HIS version of events and that is true but why shouldn't he tell his story? Others who have never met him have already published deeply unsympathetic biographies so why shouldn't he tell his story?Both his parents have told theirs and both have had theirs told by total strangers - particularly Diana who cannot respond.Harry comes across as very modest, self-effacing and disarmingly honest about himself - warts and all.His rage at the press is understandable when you consider how predatory they are.And his rage at the torrent of abuse hurled at Meghan in print and social media.I admire him for refusing to just put up and shut up and agree that the British press is deeply corrupt and toxic and needs a root and branch reform.So I applaud Harry for sticking his neck out.I know people are saying it is a cynical money grubbing exercise but it does not read that way.It is not some ghastly Hello style puff piece - quite the opposite.What happens next remains to be seen but the fact that - like his mother before him - he chose to break free makes him a true rebel and I find it is the ones who refuse to toe the line that are the most interesting."
The Real Royals of Windsor,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It may just change your mind! I’d encourage you to read Spare cover to cover-Context is crucial.,"We both loved it!! (🐶💓👑💁‍♀️). It was written in such a beautiful way. The chapters are just long enough for you to squeeze one in (like 3-4mins!) and then get back to busy life if need be! There’s been a lot of naysayers out there, but I think this was very brave of Harry to do. I can’t even imagine bottling all of that in for 35+ years. Overall, I enjoyed the summery of his growing up years, some of his “naughty’ 😏 stories (Haz will be Haz! 🤪) and for ONCE(!!!) it was very nice to hear the stories we’ve heard gossiped about in the media for the past 30-some years - straight from the horses mouth. Ya gotta live… life’s too short. And that’s what he’s doing. Happy for Harry 💛"
Alex,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought I'd just take a peek, but ended up reading cover to cover.","I was fairly ambivalent about this book (or any royal-related book)... but after seeing all the hype and some of his promo interviews, I bought it on a whim. Figured I'd skim it for all the ""big parts."" But, once I began reading, it was actually very hard to put down! It was fascinating, insightful, funny, and heartbreaking. The book is incredibly well-written and I could tell that a huge amount of work had gone into the collaborative effort. I do not feel that he was simply exposing his family and airing grievances -- he was showing the fear-driven lifestyle that has been allowed to consume them and dominate their relationships and decision-making. I will never see the media the same way again. A true Truman Show nightmare. And the Omelas reference seems all too apt. Happy he escaped this sad existence. Best of luck, Harry"
VPMD,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Found it Riveting,"Being a Royal observer since Diana, it was interesting to get a real insider look into the Royal family and the institution. While Harry is again being eviscerated by the British people and press, I suppose the truth hurts. He was brave to tell the truth, his truth to tell. Yet, I don't believe revenge was the motive and money only a part. It comes through in his words that love for his family, despite everything, is his motive. He longs for real and honest relationships with these people. His is a family full of dysfunction, passed down through generations, fueled by an archaic system that needs to go. It won't change under Charles, but hopefully William will have the guts and find the character to make real change and not simply follow the status quo."
beckie,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshingly Honest & About Time!,"I liked many things about Prince Harry's book - one of which is the fact that finally we have an honest account of what really happens within the awful confines of ""the firm"".  What a bunch of liars!  Thankfully Harry got away from them before they could do anymore damage to his family.  I applaud him writing his truths, I have NO IDEA why celebrities in the US take such pleasure in condemning his right to do so, or his right to privacy either.  THEY choose their lack of privacy & renown...Harry did NOT; he had the unfortunate circumstance to be born into it.  The way his father sold him out to the press time & again, is shameful & wrong.  I look forward to more of his books and wish him & Meghan the very best."
Lisa Fine Finds,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry has overcome so much pain within his life & still manage to be an incredible man & inspiration,"I am so looking forward to reading Prince Harry’s book Spare to learn about his life & how he is able to overcome so much pain within his life & still manage to be an incredible man & inspiration. I love Harry & Meghan & hope to be able to share in being supportive to them in any way possible. They are dealing with so many bullies, trolls, misinformation & family struggles that I feel it’s important to stand up for them & thank them for overcoming so many obstacles. There are millions of us who absolutely adore Harry & Meghan & want them to know we care, we believe in them & hope they are able to ignore the haters because they are very loved & admired."
Bond Girl ,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all what the press say it is!!,"I’ve followed the various news story over the years about the Royals. I’m not a royalist but I guess you could say that I have the same morbid curiosity regarding the Royal Family as most people do. What’s it really like? What’s the truth behind the headlines? Is it good to be that rich & that high profile?I had found the most recent press coverage on H&M rather cruel. It’s been impossible to find one positive article about them - or one that even attempts to see things from their perspective. But there’s nothing. It’s like every press reporter & editor has jumped on a bandwagon of hatred & negativity towards them. Even the most evil killers like Ian Huntley & Fred West have had less scathing articles written about them than Harry & Meghan have in the past few years. They haven’t stood a chance!Before I read this book I’d read the recent tabloid pieces that had been leaked. It was all sensationalised! It made H&M out to be desperate to destroy the monarchy in a book that was spiteful, bitter, reckless & thoughtless. They’d betrayed trusts & lied about absolutely everything - every page a blaze of vitriol against the Queen & the entire royal family. On the contrary I was surprised to find this book to be the complete opposite. Measured, considerate & extremely honest. Any ‘shocking revelations’ within the book aren’t even that. They are small, slight snippets & take up one or two lines at most. A brief question that flits into Harry’s mind, a fleeting concern. Is it? Could it be? Why? Questions that the reader finds themselves asking. And there’s nothing that’s revealed about members of the Royal Family that’s outside the realms of possibility. All families have issues & secrets. All families are complex.What the tabloids reported as an unhealthy obsession with his deceased mother was a heartbreaking insight into how losing his mother at just 12 years old moulded & affected Harry throughout his life. What the tabloids reported as a scathing attack on his father & brother is an entirely possible relationship situation taking into consideration all that has happened & their individual positions. What the tabloids reported as a selfish, sulky & spiteful move to America to stop his family seeing his children was a desperate attempt by Harry at protecting himself, his wife & his young children from the press who behaved (& continue to behave) without care or consideration for anyone else’s safety or sanity.I have been with my husband for over 20 years & the way Harry describes his relationship with Meghan is so similar to the way my husband & I both felt when we met & still feel now. We’re in love, we’ve found our person & that transcends all else. Millions of people fall in love all over the planet every day - is it so difficult to believe that Harry & Meghan have met their soul mate & that what they feel for each other is true? Why does it have to be reported as a lie? A fakery? A sham? Why does it have to be reported on AT ALL? Why does any of it matter?Whether things transpired exactly as Harry has written or if there are grey areas, nobody knows. He says in his book that at times he didn’t always fully absorb what was happening at the time & let’s face it - who does? If we had to write our own memoirs would we all have a crystal clear picture of every event & every thought that crossed our mind at that point in time? I felt that this book was an honest insight into Harry’s life, both before & after Meghan. As the world’s most prominent family, regardless of their ‘policies’, the royal family surely have every opportunity to speak out when things aren’t true? Directly or via palace spokesmen. To silence the media. Or at least correct it. But they haven’t. And they don’t. It’s almost as if the worse Harry & Meghan look, the more on a pedestal the rest of them are reported to be - even the media flurry around Prince Andrew with his sweaty, sordid & disgusting behaviour has gone quiet. And with the future of the monarchy in a lot of countries in question, the current royals are are not going to risk their positions for anything or anyone.My thoughts about the Royals have not really changed as a result of reading this book. I truly believe that they are all trapped inside an institution from which they cannot ever fully escape. The media will never let any of them lead a normal life. And I think they’re all just as dysfunctional as the rest of us!! Growing up kids dream of being a Prince or Princess. Some adults still dream of that! But the more I read about the Royal Family, good & bad, the happier I am not be involved with any of it!!!Ultimately I wish Harry & Meghan & their little family the very best of luck with everything they do. But I wish the same for the rest of the Royal Family too. And everyone else, royal or not for that matter! Life is hard, we’ve all got to do whatever we need to survive & find joy wherever we can! Nothing is guaranteed. None of us knows how long we have on this earth. It’s such a shame that we can’t all just get along."
Anne,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The spare who cares,"I found the book fascinating to read and I believe it to be accurate of Prince Harry & Megan's experience. It was difficult for me to believe Meghan did not know that she would need to curtsy when meeting the Queen and didn't know Prince Andrew!!!!! The family is dysfunctional, for sure, but who can say there family isn't.  The business side of the monarchy is as cut throat and has as many layers as any American Corporation that is always trying to cover their arse. That Harry' s family washed their hands of him and left he and his family lives in danger is truly sad. The British press is truly evil and unprofessional. I only hope Harry, Meghan and children can have peace and happiness now. They deserve it."
Noramid Pena,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful read in his own words,"I am glad Prince Harry had the opportunity to write his truth and grateful he decided to share it with the rest of the world. He didn’t have to.Though some readers may think this memoir is just to put dirt out there, I truly believe this was therapeutic for young Harry.  This book is part of his healing journey (I can relate to this. I lost my father 11 years ago and I am still processing it). I suggest, whether you picked up the physical copy, Kindle or Audible format, that when you finally sit down to read or listen, to do it with no preconceived thoughts. So much have been written about this man without his consent. The fact that this is the way he is reclaiming who he is makes this experience memorable."
RFM,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking but Diana would so proud!  A Book that's hard to put down.,"It's hard for regular people to relate to how the Royals live but after reading this book, Harry has made them so much more relatable.  I'm really impressed how down to earth Harry is and as I read each chapter I kept thinking this could not have been an easy book to write.  Even though there are some humorous moments, I found it extremely heartbreaking.  The media can be brutal and this book clearly shows just how brutal they can get.  I really hope that Harry's father and brother read the book and come to realize just how much actions or the lack of action can affect someone.  Family should always come first.  Great job, Harry!  Warmest thoughts to you and Meghan and the kids!"
Kristi Pedersen,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the read.,"I thought Prince Harry did a really good job of sharing his life and truth with compassion for those involved and with stark honesty to those called out. He speaks in loving reflection and shows his family to be complex and difficult. Who can’t relate to that?!. Interesting insight to his life with really compelling prose. His vivid descriptions of settings show that he has an artist’s eye. It was the first book in a while that I have looked forward to picking up. He is a good writer and this was an enjoyable read, regardless of your stance on the Royal Family. I am sorry for how they have been treated and wish them well. Seems to me, The Sussexes made the right choice."
Terri Gostola,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spoken from the heart.,"Here is a man who suffered a terrible trauma when he was a boy. The loss of his mother, and all the twisted circumstances surrounding her death, was so devastating to the boy that he did not fully believe her death and he continued to think she might be alive well into his adulthood. Now add to this boy's life that his deep trauma gave him a proclivity to abusing drugs and alcohol. Now add that this boy was British royalty. Now add that the British media is obsessed with anything about British royalty. Now add that the boy grew to be a remarkable man after his experiences in the military. Now add that he fell deeply in love with a remarkably strong and independent woman who happened to be American, and an actress, and divorced, and biracial.This is the kind of story that could be blockbuster fiction but it is true. All true.I wish Harry and Meghan and their children much peace and happiness."
Delores Mitchell,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,With love and Heart Warming,"I loved everything about reading “Spare”.  The hardship and negativity these two went through with no help from the palace or close family.  I can’t imagine what Harry and Megan had to deal with.  Some parts of the book made me so sad with lies being told on an hourly basis about them.  But Megan was crucified like Princess Diana.  It appears the Bee, Wasp etc. were very deceitful in planting lies to keep the Monarch in line.  I’m happy Harry gave up what hurt them the most and took care of his family..  I love Harry, Megan, Archie and Lilibeth.  I wonder, throughout history, if it was the Queen making all the decisions or the Institution .  It appears the Institution held all the cards."
Pennie Griffin,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant! Alternatively sad, happy, hilarious, and tragic.  Dysfunction at it's finest:/","The Spare draws you in immediately.  Written in almost stream of consciousness style, you follow this young man from ""the last hours of childhood"" before his mums death up to his beloved Granny's passing last year, and many of the tabloid-twisted events  in between.  It's the tale of a wonderful flawed individual who slowly but surely evolves.  He doesn't sugarcoat his mistakes. Like his mother Diana, the Princess of Wales he comes acrosss as immensely relatable, easily likeable, and ferociously protective of his family.  His total loathing for paps, press, and several untrustworthy individuals are in sharp contrast to his absolute love for his wife and children.Along the way you get glimpses of the House of Windsor being weird, funny, human, and mysteriously awful."
E. Lynn,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read. A must read.,"I started reading my friend’s book, while I was waiting to for my book the arrive from Amazon.  I felt that I needed to read it immediately because of the so called “bombshells “ that were being released by the tabloids.  I found that there were no bombshells.  This is Prince Harry telling his truth in his on words.  This book took me through a range of emotions.  The royal family has failed Prince Harry and  the institutions/firm. Family should always come first.  What gives me hope is that Prince Harry has a strong support system in Meghan and his two beautiful children.  I love their love story.  I am on my second read of the book and about the twenty view of the docuseries."

Moehringer, the ghost writer, whose name should have appeared on the cover somewhere.  Very nice job.  I would say I could NEVER live in the fishbowl Harry lives in or deal with the constant paparazzi.  For any little girl or boy who thinks it would be wonderful to grow up to be a prince or princess, I would say this book would shatter their illusions. I think by moving away Prince Harry improved his lot in life. And why the big deal about Harry moving abroad? His cousins, Beatrice and Eugenie, also live in New York and Portugal.  Buy the book.  It explains a lot."
Linda Tarlow,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,No More Clicking On The Royals For Me,"I've always been into the Royals.  I guess I has a fascination with the wealth, the charmed lives.  I even bought into ""bad Megan"".  But no more.  Harry has pulled back the curtain on a family and lifestyle with an unimaginable level of dysfunction.  Royal lives are not at all charmed - they're bizarre and awful.  This is a deeply moving and honest portrayal of life within the monarchy.  My heart broke for Harry... and Megan... over and over again.  And what about Charlotte, et. al?  What kind of future do they face? The British monarchy is a sick and broken system.  Absolutely worth reading.  You'll never look at the Royals the same way again, or at all, for that matter."
amazon fan,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very chilling,"Very interesting book but I was stopped in my tracks by a passage on page 373.  Harry was describing his experience at the WellChild Awards after which he received a text from his brother saying Harry wasn't well and needed help.  You'd need to read the page or two to appreciate the full context, but it reminded me of the tactics used 100 years ago and more when a more powerful family member wanted to get rid of a pesky wife or relative who got in the way or didn't ""submit"".  ""You are unwell and will need to go to the country estate"" as you're being dragged away by footmen and bundled off to wherever.  Oh, William, too bad for you this isn't the 19th century.  Not a good look."
Kate Holzmueller,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super engaging memoir, highly recommend","On part 3! So haven't finished YET but I am enjoying this memoir. I love all memoirs--this one is especially interesting because it's from the point of view of someone so often in the public eye. I am enjoying the short chapters and the honesty with which he describes his thoughts and emotions at events that I saw in the media-his mother's funeral, his brother's wedding, his own wedding. I feel like he does a really good job of describing people with nuance and with kindness and my only complaint / criticism is that I wonder what Megan's memoir would say. He paints her in a very flattering light--which makes sense! He loves her and she's his wife! But I would be interested in hearing / reading about things she struggles with, too."
Megan,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally truth spoken straight from the source!  An excellent memoir.,"Prince Harry did an excellent job of detailing his past, representing himself and telling his story.  Just as quoted in the Netflix Harry and Meghan story- with the stakes so high, isn't it better to hear the story from those to whom it belongs?  Harry tells that story as he has lived it, interpreted it and done an exemplary job in doing so. He has chosen to live his life, to love and enjoy his family to the best of his ability; that choice has cost him his country, his family and so much more; however I think he has gained more than lost- he gained the ability to be himself and to live his life being true to himself.  It is liberating to see him have such love and passion for his wife, mother and children and to have the courage to take a step back from everything he has ever known and make a good life for them and to find freedom as best he can.  He is doing amazing things and should be congratulated for that, for his courage and strength to stand up for what is right.  Their story is emboldening and a pillar of strength for all of us.I can't imagine having the media involved in every aspect of my life, constantly being sized up and judged by people who don't even know me with a popularity scale, never really allowed to have a private moment.  I now see William as a stuffy, pompous ass brother that is jealous and can't stand it when he isn't in the spotlight, being congratulated as number #1.  How sad to have a brother that is so selfish and self absorbed as he has proven to be, let alone a self absorbed father.It's frustrating to see how the media (which after reading the book makes it clear) they are set on their intent to do ill will by pulling segments of the book and twisting the meaning in a negative way. - all for a negative headline, intent to cause hurt and ruin.  It has all been very eye opening to see this negative backlash knowing the backstory from the Netflix series.I wish Harry, Meghan and their children the very best and hope they can find the true happiness they so very much deserve.  They are an inspiring pair and I applaud them for their courage and strength."

It was so easy to read and difficult to put down.  He painted pictures so well that at times I thought I could smell his surroundings. Loved Harry’s honesty, his character, his humanness, the man he’s been and become.  It takes guts and courage to write his truth.  I hope America continues to be good to him and his lovely family.  I hope the Brits will one day understand his problem-solving style and his need to care for himself and his family that has zero to do with him being selfish.  Member of the Royal Family have each suffered so much.  I hope there is healing for everyone.  Thank you for sharing your truth."
Susan Bowersox,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVED this BOOK!,"What can I say?  I loved this book, as heartbreaking as it was to read.  How ANY family could treat their son as Harry was treated is beyond my comprehension.  He was just twelve years old when his mother was stripped from he and William.  Nothing was done to comfort, console or counsel those boys.  The British, especially the Monarch can be so very cold.  This thoughtfully, carefully written book provides Harry's side of the story, his history, his heart.  I laughed, I cried, but most of all I have a new respect for this remarkable, strong, intelligent, loving young man - - who chose to stand up for his family.  Something his own father didn't do.  I won't forget this book ever.  READ IT!!!"
AvidReader,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than I Expected,"Considering Harry called himself a poor student, I thought he did an exceptionally good job in the writing of this book. The writing is clear, clever, never dull and poetic at some junctures. I think the biggest surprise for me was that the brothers weren't closer growing up. It always seemed that they were. But it's easy to see that a big brother who is the heir to the throne and the younger brother who isn't might have significant challenges getting along. And all the fuss about their arguing seems so trivial. Brothers fight, sometimes it gets physical, sometimes people shout when they're angry. So what? Welcome to the world. The haters out there need to lay off. Nobody's perfect. Live and let live."
WellWishes,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written - wide range of emotions,"Watched all the interviews that Harry gave for this book.  My favorite one was the Stephen Colbert one and it made me eager to read the book.  I was lucky to have reserved the book from the library months ahead and received the library book 1 day after the book release. Read the book over the weekend.  The book is well written and takes you through a wide range of emotions.  It is nothing like the sensational headlines you see in the news.After finishing the library book, I  immediately went onto Amazon and purchased the book.  Not because I will read it again, but it is a little gestureI to show support for Prince Harry."
LaurenB,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stepping out from behind and into a life of love and new purpose,"I felt as though I was reading a long letter from a friend. Harry shares his life, experiences, thoughts and feelings openly and compassionately. He tells it like it is—doesn’t sugarcoat and yet consistently expresses his wish for things to be different than they are. He calls out familial poor behavior as kindly and compassionately as possible while being firm and extending more grace than what is likely deserved.British media are ruthless, cunning, racist and incredibly heartless, focused on headlines and money. No one could or should have to live with the frequent almost daily vitriol that is spewed at and about him, Meghan, and their family.This is a very well-written book and I hope others will have more understanding and compassion for him and Meghan after reading—I wish them peace and happiness."
Love to read,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Family should be a safe haven,"Yes, family should be a safe haven Royal or not. I could not put it down. Very disheartening to hear that there is such strife between family members when they should be supporting lifting up protecting each other.  Staff should not ever have such power as they do. Is it any Wonder there was escapism alcohol drugs, that happens to many. It doesn't excuse it but not everyone has healthy coping mechanisms and when you are under a magnifying glass it seems to be more difficult.  It's sad to think that staff have more pull than family members. What would happen if they banded together became United. Food for thought. Maybe one day this will come to pass, there's always hope. So much respect for Harry and Megan."
Chulete Keane,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mental Health Awareness,"I enjoyed the book. At times there were things I though should have been left unsaid but I loved the honesty. I loved that King Charles can understand the struggle of parenting with 2 kids who constantly argue 😂. What I took from this is the Royals need education on Mental Health and how it is real and they probably struggle with these issues. This stiff upper lip stuff needs to stop and they need to truly make sure they are getting help. Harry lost his mom tragically and he needed therapy and a hug. Harry seem to be affectionate and he didn’t receive that when he needed it most. I think people need to read this book with an open mind and stop being angry at Harry. If you don’t like him don’t come on here giving reviews that are negative, to be mean. Mental Health issues are real and long lasting. He doesn’t need to be bullied, he needs understand. Recommend Royal Family take 5 Love Language test! Also Harry wave the white flag and make up with your brother before it is too late, he is the only brother you have."
CCYT16,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grace,"An honest, raw and human account of his own imperfect life that ultimately pleads for and earns himself grace. I applaud him for telling hisStory and urge others to try to put themselves in his shoes. Have some grace! Love always wins.Matthew 7:3-5“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.”"
Tarra B.,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Humanizing,"This book was a page turner. I picked it up because I was curious, and I couldn't put it down because I was hooked by Harry's story telling. This account of Harry's life was at times charming, sad, infuriating, and poignant. This book is a testament for mental health and healing from traumas including dysfunctional family systems with triangulation, gas-lighting, invalidating reality, and the kitchen sink. It is a tale as old as time when someone is brave enough to step into a healing journey that includes mental health and begins to set boundaries against those who feel boundaries should not exist for them. Even in families not of Royal birth this cycle plays out because the status quo is safe and change is unknown, risky. We can cope with the status quo we are vulnerable with the unknown. Resistance is a part of this journey.Harry's story will resonate with readers who've also experienced traumas themselves and lessens stigma around seeking out mental health.They say the Scottish Order of the Thistle's creed is:  Nemo me impune lacessit. No one may attack me with impunity. In one fell swoop Harry has demonstrated more backbone, bravery, and courage to bring this to light and hold accountable those who feel above reproach than anyone else mentioned in its pages.Frost bitten todger or no, the man's got brass danglers."
Jonny,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW!!!,"I grew up watching these boys grow up and I always felt like Harry didn't fit in and would some day break away. But I had no idea just how toxic it was for him. Anyone who has ever tried to break free of toxic, gaslighting family will feel his pain. Anyone who has ever felt hung out to dry or abandoned by their family, will get it. I am genuinely shocked that he didn't end up a drug addict or dead from an overdose.....  Harry: (if you ever see this, which is doubtful) Please know that YOU WON! You not only survived but you are now thriving. Thank you for sharing your story. We wish you only the best!! 🤩"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile Read.,"Honest, poignant, and beautifully written. I’ve seen tabloids on the newsstands at checkouts in grocery stores growing up and have thought, well who looks at those and thinks that they’re telling the truth? Furthermore, who has time to listen to those over-opinionated talk shows? People with no life or are seriously mentally ill or impaired? The articles that pop-up constantly about who supposedly did this or that. Who cares? Boring! At some point you want to know the truth behind all the gossip, libel, and slander.This was a great read and a good look into how the English monarchy works. Thank you Harry and Meghan for staying true to yourselves and for standing up to the injustices brought against you and your beautiful family."
Candy,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Proud of Prince Harry!,"I couldn't put this book down. The authentic honestly and life history of Prince Harry was very revealing. I am so glad he put down in words his truth. I am so happy that he, Meg, Archie and Lillibet now live freely in America! No royal title, no amount of money, no real security, no family support, is no way for anyone to live. Freedom is the real key to happiness. And Prince Harry has become his own man, told his own truth and stands by and up for his family. He is his Mother's son through and through. And I am sure that Princess Diana is smiling down at him from heaven with pride! This book is a must read. A page turner till the end. Bravo!"
KatChat,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth Every Penny,"The royal family hasn't been on my radar since the Diana days, but the hate in their press over the last several years (especially the online versions) got my attention.  Having lived with the results of biased media here in the U.S., I know better than to believe anything the rags say.  Grew up averting my gaze from the Enquirer and News of the World at check stands.  That trash was for old people I thought.  Alien babies and sightings of Elvis years after his death.  The UK rags seem even worse so it's amazing to have a book such as Spare which I just finished reading.  A beautifully written inside look into Prince Harry's life since childhood.  I laughed, I cried, I beamed with pride, and routed for him and Meghan.  It is his truth and I am so glad he shared.  Excellent read.  I wish him and his family a brilliant, loving future."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry survived such abuse by his family and the British media,"I knew Harry and Meghan suffered abuse by the media, but I had no idea the extent of abuse via coverups and collaborations with the British media by his own family.  Their own interests and image is all they cared about.  His own father, step mother and brother were complicit in always making him look bad in the press so they themselves always became the victims of Harry’s actions.  His father is nothing but selfish, and his brother is pure evil.  Lies about Harry and Meghan were fed to the media by both his father and brother.  I’m so glad they found a way out of that hellhole.  I wish them only love and peace in the future."
J. S. N,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eye opening and readable,"First let me say the writing and storytelling are excellent.  I personally could have done with a few pages less on his time overseas. Other than that, I have no criticisms.There is a surprising amount of detail and honesty in this book.  Prince Harry doesn't shy away from parts of his earlier life that don't reflect well on him.  I read the book in one day and my first thought after finishing it was - it was sadder than I expected it would be. I totally understand why he and the Duchess moved after reading this. As demonstrated throughout the book, castles and financial security don't necessarily equate to a happy life. If you're thinking of reading it, I definitely recommend picking it up."
Molly,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Emotional & Heartfelt,"I’ve never been a big royal fan. My mom was obsessed with Diana and over the years I felt so sad for Harry. He always seemed so perplexed. I’d check in on big events - when he was in the army, when he married Meghan, when he had his kids. When I heard about his book I knew I needed to hear his side of the story. I’m so glad I did. His mother’s death really set him on a path of hurt and turmoil. It was so refreshing to hear all of his experiences. It’s such an amazing book filled with sadness, laughter, and deep inner work he did through therapy. It’s a book for everyone - but especially those that always wondered what he was thinking. Definitely recommend."
Maggie,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unexpectedly Sweet & Funny,"I was curious so I pre-ordered a copy of the book and I'm glad I did. Far from what has been portrayed in some media I found the book sweet, sad and funny. Harry is very self depreciating and he actually speaks of the Royal Family with a wistfulness and sadness I could feel. When he talked about the resemblance to Diana fading from his brother William is was with a sense of loss as the relationship with his big brother was crumbling. I had thought they were close and didn't realize the entire institution treated him exactly like a spare his whole life. What a terrible thing to tell a child through actions & sly comments. ""Well you're not all that important unless your brother dies"", that's just monstrous."
David,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Harry’s reflections: Challenging, heart-rendering. Aims to put the record right","A lot of folk seem to have an opinion of someone the’ve never met and about a book they’ve not read. Most gained from what the media has said and written about him and his wife which has not been verified.I’ve read the book with an open mind - The media and Palace officials have a lot to answer for. A lot of mis info and outright lies were released and printed without being challenged.His reflections and account may be uncomfortable for some but he has been in the shadow of his late mother and brother trying to forge a life away from prying eyes and tittle tatter.Yes, he was born into privilege but he comes across as a likeable individual who has faced his demons, had a challenging upbringing, but has already achieved more than most, still misses his mother, and has found true love and now has a family of his own against all the odds.A troubled individual who has opened up his heart to the reader as part of his own healing journey.A thought-provoking well written book. If it upsets some individuals and criticises the institution of royalty, government, and press then so be it. Lessons need to be learnt and attitudes changed for the good of all of us."
helloitsme,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very touching and well written,"I am not a ""royal"" follower and have never understood their purpose.  Due to the in your face tv and newspaper headlines and stories, I am aware of the events surrounding the family.  I was interested in this book due to the very disturbing journey Harry has been on.  I feel his hurt and sorrow in this book.  The real betrayal he felt from his family, the trauma he has been subjected to, the being paraded out to the public even as a child without any protection but for Diana.  The simple fact that he was never taught, allowed or even knew how to express his grief.  Yes, he has lived a ""privileged"" life, but that does not diminish his pain and trauma.  In many ways it makes it more difficult.  His journey has been gut wrenching.  His love for his wife and children, and for his family is strong and true.  He has overcome so much, and I was also touched by his honestly and vulnerability in this book.  Shame on the royal family for not protecting he and Megan.  Shame on them for ripping security away as they had an infant and were getting death threats.  Shame on Murdach and his dirty rag tabloids.  Good for Harry and Megan for taking such brave steps to live their own life start anew.  I am sure it is very difficult.  Harry, I wish you  healing and peace, as much as you can."
Joy R Wimer DeLima,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Good!!,"Long Book! But well written.  I am very impressed with Prince Harry!  and also Meghan.  I truly believe that just about anything being said of them, that is negative is jealously, because they have made their own way.  His brother is a mess of contradiction, within himself.  His Father and especially Camilla I cannot stand.  The Monarchy is a sad old Tradition.  I am glad that he broke away and freed his family for their sake. His military service!  Amazing!  The poachers in Africa! This is horrible what is happening!  I was crying over that chapter.  I am not even finished with this Book, and cannot wait to read the rest.  I recommend!"
Blue Jay,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Context is everything,"I placed an order for Spare prior to its release. Then cancelled the order after all the negative coverage it received after the Spanish version had been leaked. Then, after watching Prince Harry’s full interview with Stephen Colbert, I went through with the purchase because I really did want to hear what the exiled prince had to say about himself. I was not disappointed—the negative press the book has received focuses on click-bait content. In reality, Spare is deeply introspective and tenderly vulnerable. Strip the biased media mayhem, and the book is actually a very enjoyable read that will resonate with anyone who has experienced the grief of losing a loved one, trauma, or family estrangement. It’s a fun read — and a Prince Harry is right, context is everything."
CLE mommy,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read,"I’m a fan of the British monarchy, (not sure why as an American) but I’ve always been fascinated by the Windsors.  I have always loved both William and Harry, as they breathed new and modern life into the institution.  I fell in love with Meghan and Harry from the start, couldn’t understand what the haters saw in her.  Anyway, this book was well-written, at times fascinating, other times enlightening.  I was grateful for the opportunity to hear the story from the person actually in the thick of it, rather than statements and press releases, and social media.  It really shed light on the institution and its formalities, expectations, and traditions.  So very interesting and endearing.  Thank you Harry for sharing your story!"
Kathleen M,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent,"Clear, well written, both heartbreaking and witty. I never once had the impression that this very plain spoken man was out to hurt or embarrass any family members. Harry suffered an unimaginable loss at a very vulnerable stage of his life and had to suffer silently, as dictated by the norms of his family. Both sad and joyful, describing the best years of his life in the army, then exploring, and meeting Meghan of course. I’ve personally read some of the abuse directed at both him and later Meghan in the British press, and I don’t know how anyone can deal with the cruelty and slander. The real villains are the relentless paparazzi. Aside from that, portions of this book had me laughing my head off, he’s very, very dry and surprisingly self effacing. I would urge all potential book lovers to read this- I think you’ll be in for a pleasant surprise.PS: it never occurred to me that a visit to the North Pole could cause some rather shocking symptoms."
Robert216,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to put down this one-of-a-kind memoir,"I'd be hard-pressed to believe anyone who says this book is anything but masterful in terms of storytelling and engagement level. Even those who dislike Prince Harry will find this memoir nearly unputdownable.From the decision to start the narrative with the Stunde Null of Diana's death rather than the earliest years of Harry's childhood (a choice that makes more meaningful the memories of the Time Before that do come up for him during therapy, late in the book), to the powerful hummingbird metaphor that ends the epilogue, this whole memoir is a masterclass in autobiography. If you dislike Harry, I suppose you might feel enraged while reading Spare. But you certainly won't be bored.I predict this book will have a long-lasting effect on the British monarchy. I'm not saying it will cause its downfall (after a millennium, no one book could do that). But just that never before has the mystique of monarchy been pierced quite so dramatically, nor has one of its members ever been nearly so candid. This memoir goes beyond the space occupied by ""Diana: Her True Story"" or any of the other 1990s Diana soul-baring, taking us to a new level of frankness. This is the story of a man born into an almost singularly unique set of circumstances -- but, in the end, he's indeed like all the rest of us: struggling to find his way, bound by family traditions and dysfunction, and buoyed by take-out food, ""Friends"" reruns, and the love of a spouse.It's a wild ride. But if you love a good story, take the ride nonetheless, no matter what you think of Harry."
Chiara Ripamonti,Reviewed in Germany on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written, a good book","Like many, I bought the Kindle version out of curiosity and it was a pleasant surprise.The book reports a tale of a boy, then a man, growing up, dealing with trauma, the pressures of an important family and the normal challenges of coming of age. There is no big boasting, no big revealing scoop, just a very normal life, with its ups and downs.In the book there is no attacking the Royal Family, it just seems to downsize the royals to a normal family, where people sometimes have different points of view, some old-fashion ideas, but nothing more. Maybe the saint-like status of the RF cracks a little bit, but it would be about time to let go of that obssession. If you're looking for a scoop or a great scandal you won't find anything of the sort.If the content comes directly from the prince, the writer is up to his fame, the book is perfectly written."
Pamela J Wyzgala,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read - Extremely Well-Done Autobiography,"I was expecting another in a long line of tepid royal biographies with limp, well-trodden ""revelations"" that had been in the news countless times before, rehashed and bloodless.  So NOT the case with this book! I was pleasantly surprised that the writing was first-rate, and thoroughly captured the personality and speaking style of Prince Harry himself. I hope people actually read this book themselves and not just rely on what is being publicized in the press (very misleading), paraphrased and summarized. The real words in the book tell a very different story and perspective than what reviews or excerpts I've seen, and this is a story worth hearing. The racism evidenced in the treatment of Megan has always been shocking in it's blatancy, banality and pervasiveness - it deserves being called out for what it is, completely detestable.  Harry managed to escape the royal golden cage. It's very sad that he was driven away from his immediate family by the unscrupulous behavior and influence of the royal ""hangers-on"" , courtiers who seem to wield the real power behind the throne. I can't wait for the next sequel!"
J.S.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Insight to life as a Royal family member was interesting and yet sad.  So many rules to follow. Having to ask permission from Queen, his father and William.  Spies within leaking things to the press. Prince Harry not allowed to set the record straight to lies.  Some things could have been left unsaid. Too personal.  I enjoyed reading his accounts of experiences at war and when in Africa. Proud of his loyalty to Meghan standing up to his father and brother for her. Glad he was able to tell his story.  Royal family members wear masks. Play acting when in public is so hypocritical and dysfunctional.  Harry and Meghan are down to Earth and I am happy they broke free."
Renee ,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An honest, painful book","Prince Harry's Spare was a great read. Camilla, William, and Kate are just how I expected them to be. (Apparently, telling Kate ""baby brain"" and hormones can make a person forgetful, was an unforgivable offense to the future queen.) King Charles allowed his wife to feed lies to the press about Harry, from childhood on, to protect her own son. Prince William didn't like Harry having more freedom, being that he was only the spare, so he punished Harry. The worst offenders, aside from Camilla, are the palace staffers. They plant stories, plant lies, they lied to the Queen, and believe they run the family, and it's members must do as they're told. The worst was the royal family causing Meghan's miscarriage."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dedicated to Family,"They always say there are two sides to every story and the truth lies someplace in the middle.  I am happy for Harry that he finally got to tell his truth, after he felt so much untruth was out of his control.  This book was very well written.  I didn't want to stop till I was done.  I was not left with a feeling of hatred for the royal family.  I simply read a story about a man who also loves his wife, and kids.  A man who hates the UK media for just cause, and was willing to move mountains to protect his family.  For me it was really that simple.  Thank you for sharing your story, Harry, and putting your family first."

Doesn’t mean every reader has to agree with all facets of his side, but I can respect that it is *his* and no one else’s.In terms of the writing, I really have enjoyed this so far! Harry lets his cheeky personality show, even in subtle ways. The imagery is fantastic, which is something that I often find lacking in memoirs. Of course he’s going to go into detail of his experience and hardships! It’s storytelling, not whining. He also goes into detail of the good times and truly honors Diana. I can honestly say I’ve learned something new about how the institution works, the military, and British government from this book which is also refreshing compared to most memoirs!"
Amber,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Respectfully revealing,"Prince Harry does a great job sharing his story in a raw and descriptive account. He notes when his memory may be inaccurate and where he may have blind spots in understanding his family's take on things. It's definitely not a ""tell all"" that bashes family members. It also isn't an empty retelling of everything we've already seen in news and interviews. He tells his perspective and experience of events, which I'm appreciative he was willing to share. He's very descriptive of the scenes he recalls, so you get the feeling you're experiencing it with him as he tells it. Only the people involved know the ""truth"" of situations, but, based on the sincerity of his writing, this seems to be his truth."

Actors and musicians may be the closest we come to them. I can not understand why his family has not supported him either emotionally or financially. According to the story Harry has essentially been thrown out of his family. He is no longer receiving any financial or emotional support.Meanwhile I found his story very compelling. He tells a very good story and admits he can't member everyone's name and all the specific accents in his story but the story remains entertaining.Harry and Men's story is not over. I wish both of them and their children have a great and safe life.

I thought it was an engrossing read--I couldn't put it down. It was well-written and interesting, with some funny parts.The section about his career in the army and tours in Afghanistan were informative and thoughtfully written.I was really shocked at the vast different between appearances and reality, with regard to his relationship with his brother. The family's lack of physical affection strikes me as bizarre. If you thought the royals seemed cold to each other in The Crown, this book blows that out of the water.Overall, the book is about one man's journey to break generational curses / break through his own trauma. Best wishes to Harry and Meghan, and to the rest of the family."

Unfortunately there will be haters no matter what you do or say and it is sad. I commend you for your bravery and courage.I love your honesty. Most men should be like you. You take care of your wife and kids. That’s a real man. You did that.
Gerald's Girl,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN...,"I loved Harry telling his story in his own words. Some parts, made me smile, chuckle and cry. It was a riveting story of the loss of his mum and the finding of the love of his life, Meghan. The part where he and Meghan meet and get together was like reading a romance novel. I bought the hardback for the living room table and bought the e-book for my Kindle. However, the audio was the best. Love listening to Harry read the book to me. It's good to know there are some men who will do everything to protect the woman they love. This book was worth the purchase and will be the greatest non-fiction book of all time."
Ris,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Press hates this book because they are being called out. READ THIS BOOK!,"Gentle, sweet and a bit overshare but non the less a powerful read. This book was raw and came across as, truth, Prince Harry's truth, which is why I read-to hear his side of this story. People commenting on this book complain about him and exposing the truth. If we don't expose the darkness, nothing changes, pain continues and Princess Diana is an example of this. Harry is tired of it, as we all should be. Read this book for a perspective that comes after therapy which should leave you hopeful. I was left proud of Prince Harry, as I'm sure his Mom is.I read it in 2 days, stayed up until the wee hours of the night because it was THAT captivating!"
Julie Magill,Reviewed in Australia on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read this book for your own opinion,"I read this book with trepidation after all the media hype and Harry and Megan's constant airing of their issues.  I am pleased I did.  It is an honest and emotional account of his life and history.  The media is taking small snippets and sensationalizing as they usually do. It does show his immense love for his dad and 'Willy' but also shows 'Willy' as an entitled and pompous heir, not the compassionate caring person I always believed he inherited from his mother.  Seems only Harry as that.While he is very open about the lack of support and care from his Royal family when he needed it most, he is also very open about his great love for them and hurt and confusion on their attitudes in different instances.Harry grew up, by accounts of this book, a very troubled teen and man, dealing with his mums death and trying to find purpose in his life.  Also dealing with such a horrid and dangerous media all his life, especially after their involvement in his mothers death caused him immense grief.He is not against the Monarchy just its archaic rules, attitude and media control over them.Otherwise a great and enlightening read. Helps to understand where he is at today, I understand his bitterness and anger, but its time to move forward, stop publicly airing his griefs and relying on royal status to succeed and enjoy his new happy life with his lovely family."
Kelly A,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartfelt, insightful, and truthful","Anyone with the sense to see through the ridiculous spin the British media puts on this man and his wife should read this book.It’s far from just some airing of grievances. He talks about his family with such unwavering love, despite how poorly it’s reciprocated. He talks about his time in the military, how it gave him a purpose, a reason for being. He talks about his mental health, the ups and downs, the ways it affected his life and relationships.And he talks about the press and their slimy relationships with press offices and even slimier courtiers. It made me furious, and I think UK citizens should be quite concerned by who holds the real power in the monarchy & media.It was a very emotional read. Very heartfelt, full of so much grief and longing and struggle. I’m so happy Harry and Meghan are in a good place now."
Misty D Brown,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A honorable Man’s Story, Here is the True Prince!","I admire Prince Harry’s strength. He is a true Prince. This story is heartbreaking. The thoughts of a child not feeling important to his father. His family has let him, Megan & children feel less important then their (the King & Prince’s) titles. Does the Royal Family need the press to stay in power? If so, they just feed their children to them? William needs to think about how he treats his brother and realize his daughter is also the second child. I pray his beautiful daughter never feels unwanted as his (William’s) brother does.This book was well written. I felt the authors life play out as I read.Job well done Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fireside chat ?,"I like the telling of Harry story by Harry. It was told with no blinders on. It felt like he was just answering the question of ok , So  tell me about yourself. It seems like it started not at his birth but when his mom died. It was heart wrenching to know that he we t to sleep one night and woke up to be informed that his life was forever changed. The lack of comfort was incredibly sad. He was very direct about flaws  and heart breaks.  The book was broken down into 3 parts .  It was and engaging read and I found  myself taking notes. Whatever camp you're in him give it a read with no reservations."
Cookie,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,moving. from the heart.,"As an adult child from a dysfunctional home, I identified with so much of the emotions here. But all I had endured was not for world viewing. I commend Harry for sharing his truth. Truly grace under fire. It seems he and his brother, as heir and spare were destined to separate. William was petted, indulged and so on as the future king. Harry could never measure up and although held to strict rules and protocol his brother William was even more restrained. Resentment on both sides is understandable. The sibling rivalry was nurtured more than these motherless teens were nurtured. I found it to be a very interesting read. Harry, only the best for you, Meghan and your children."
Mizzie ,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Harry’s story - refreshingly honest,"It’s good to hear Harry’s side of the story - the book firmly takes aim at the British press (deservedly so) and hits the bullseye repeatedly, from News of the World to the Sun to the Daily Mail. The British press has been thoroughly revolting in its coverage of Harry - and Meghan - for years. I was a child, younger than Harry, when 1997 happened, and since then I have thought ‘the press must leave those boys alone!’ But they haven’t.People who haven’t read the book will go ‘oh he’s throwing his whole family under the bus’ but truthfully aside from a few veiled remarks, and moments where he is directly affected by the behaviour of others - Harry doesn’t. You can tell that even in this write-up, there is the pain of an estranged son and brother who loves his family and wants a relationship with them.I removed a star only because it kept referring to the English monarchy - as opposed to it being  the monarchy of the UK. I noticed in the acknowledgments that there was actually a fact checker involved and I felt that this was such a basic fact it should have been pointed out. There has been no ‘Queen of England’ since Anne in the early 18th century, no ‘King of England’ since William III before her. This is important because England is *not* the UK. Sorry for that criticism but it’s true!Read it, because it’s a good insight into Harry’s life, and it’ll really upset the British press to see it do well!"
DJCP51,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A new perspective for me,"I have always been interested in the royals…mainly because I loved Diana and felt she got robbed on every level…too short a life, cheating husband, etc etcI have to admit I was team William but I realize these boys have the same relationship I have with my sister…she’s thinks she’s above everyone, spoiled, and always looking down her nose at people….it made me sad for Harry and gave me new perspective. I have to say I’m more understanding of Harry’s life and position in the family. If he’s whining then maybe I have been too about my sister…..who knows? I’m disappointed in William, Kate, Charles….and maybe even the Queen. It isn’t fun being second fiddle…I can relate….Very good book…well written and relatable!"
Amanda Messina,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even if you don't like Biographies or Royals, you will enjoy this!","First off, I did a combination of reading and listening. Harry read the book himself and was delightful to listen to, very natural, honest, and forthright. I thought his story was compelling and there was so much to learn about. The stuff about his marriage is only part of the story so if that is all you want to read about, maybe just get it at the library and skip to that.Harry explains his upbringing, the loss of his iconic mother, his work, school and more. I've read books about The Royal Family and watched documentaries. This was the first time though, that I understood the whole business of it. It was really enlightening.This is a nice dude. For sure."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good book,"Enjoyed the book very much. It was well written.  I bought the Kindle version after reading some of the reviews and watching some interviews.  The parts about his mother dying are heartbreakingly sad.  Some of how he feels and his brother feels can be attributable to sibling rivalry.  The British press - read the Daily Mail - generate news they don’t just report it. They distort, subvert and seem to routinely lie.  It must be awful to have this directed at you or worse at someone you love.  No one really comes off as a villain and it seems just an attempt to explain himself.  Hopefully, in time, his family can mend itself, you can tell he loves them."
Carol A. Schmidt,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"I loved his honesty.  While dirty laundry should not be aired in public, I believe he did what needed to be done. People think of Royalty as untouchable.  While you have to abide by the system, you still need to show your children love, hope and above everything that you have their back. You believe in them. You celebrate their accomplishments and above all, you hug them, you show them you love them and show them how to love. Harry and Meg are living the life Diana was not able to live and I'm certain she is in the background saying, you have this my son. Live  the  dream I couldn't live and be happy."
Reader/Quilter,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thoughtful, heartbreaking and a must read.","This book interested me from the fist page.  Harry loves his family, and most of them seem to only love the ""job"".  How devastating to know that you are not worth love, unless you bow to the ""job"".  Harry is a Prince by blood, a son by birth, a brother by birth, a Royal by birth, and should be respected for his struggles, and admired for his devotion to the protection of his wife and children.  I know and feel the struggles he has been through because of a public duty by a parent, and I only hope his children admire him when he is older, for telling HIS story, and trying to regain his FAMILY, without obligation to the ""job"".  There is no way all the people who are bashing him and Meghan to know the real truth, they are not living it."
C. Houghton,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a beautiful book: flawed, funny, touching, yet sad, even tragic, but in the end hopeful","Prince Harry ain’t much of a writer, even with what editorial help he may have had there are factual errors (he’s not descended from Henry VI, that King had no living heirs) & parts that seem to have not been completely thought out, but it’s engaging. It’s in his voice, it reads the way he talks, but if only half of this book is true (I believe it all is, it seems honest) I’m glad they’ve found a way out, even as painful this has all been.I hope Harry & Meg find the peace they’ve looked for. They have been through so much, they & their kids deserve a happily-ever-after."
Connie,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyed the book,"Touching story of a young boy who lost his Mum in the most tragic way & the toll it took on him, to finally getting help to express his grief. The military career he so dedicated himself to & then being striped when he had to walk away from a toxic environment within the Royal institution. Harry expressed love & admiration for his father, his brother, his grandmother, I never felt he was anythng but frustrated by the people who control the Royal family & the skullduggery that comes with being born into this family. Happily, he finds the love of his life & has built a good life. Keep your head up, ignore the gossip & continue to live your life."
DG from Kansas,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trauma survivors will see themselves on every page,"If you purchase this book for salacious gossip about the British royals, you'll be disappointed.  Prince Harry was quite measured in his depiction of his life as a royal.  For reviewers commenting that he whined throughout the book, I would ask that you reconsider how trauma has shaped his life and mental health.  I particularly enjoyed his accounts of his time in Africa and his military service.  I would actually love for him to do a book about his conservation work on the African continent.  The treatment he and Meghan received at the hands of the press (and, likely, family members) is despicable.  I'm grateful that they were able to leave and hope they can find peace, happiness and safety wherever they live."
Anah Taylor,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, compelling","Loved it. Every word. One of those books a reader can't put down. Made me laugh and made me cry, painful sometimes to read as it was raw emotion of how his mums death impacted  Harry's entire life. It took a lot of courage to expose that institution for what it is: heartless and cruel. And it obviously cut him deeply to see how again and again, his family chose the institution and  themselves over him. Shameful. It is clear Harry now feels loved; he and Meghan do have a true love story. His father and his brother should apologize and bring Harry and his family back into the fold. They need what Meghan brings in order to keep the institution relevant."
Liz L.,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, Beautifully Written Memories of a Unique Life","The detail and integrity of this book surprised me.  Prince Harry honors transformation and change throughout his life via his unique experiences as a second son in a royal family.  I am glad he shared his side of the story and have no doubt that the media is deeply out of control in every country.  Paps are the cannibals in this book, yet he and Meghan have managed to move on.  This is an excellent read, and I highly recommend it.  The little highlight blurbs about the book that I've read in many media outlets are misleading.  The book is much richer and more nuanced than that."
MrsC2,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its his story to tell,"First as a mother I just want to just hug Harry. My heart breaks for him, not having his mother for the loving support all these years is heartbreaking.  The royal family seems so cold and dysfunctional for centuries, but now as he reveals the truth behind the doors he is crucified for it by some.  It's his life to live and tell, and reveal through the pain. Meghan has given him love and the courage to go on. This book is amazing. I only hope his father and brother will someday understand. He is also telling their story that they are too afraid to tell, because of their rank.I hope this gives him a sigh of relief to continue his life in happiness with Meghan and his children."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read!,"I loved this book; in fact it is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.  It seemed that there was a new fact in every sentence.  Harry should write more books; that it is written so well.  Of course, it is his life that he is writting about; it is not fiction.  It took me 4 nites to read; it was a page -turner for me.I don't understand the hate that I've read in comments.  It seems to me; some of the people really hate Megan for no reason at all.  It's prejudice and jealousness, clear and simple.  Good luck to them and their family."
Molly Moore,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible,"Context  is everything. It’s such a beautiful autobiography, describing his experience, telling his story, in his words. It’s not the sensational story the media is selling. It’s so real, honest and vulnerable. I have the audiobook and physical book, I think audio is the way to go with this one because you can hear the emotion in his voice. I highly recommend that everyone read this before making up their mind on how they feel towards him and Meghan. I, also, loved the mental health journey you can see him navigating in his life this far. You see his disassociation, his avoidance, and then his growth and coming to terms. It’s a fantastic mental health read, as well. So so good. 10/10 recommend."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Enduring courage to be a man, husband, and father to make his Mum proud","As a faithful fan of Princess Diana, this reader has followed Prince Harry since he was a baby.  I have loved him but in this book I now also admire him for his wise decisions.  This autobiography gives the facts of his suffering from the age of 12.  There is so much proof of the uncomfortable position of a Spare made to feel inferior to the Heir simply due to birth order.  So many events are much clearer as the facts of his life are narrated. His affection for his wife and determination to prevent her from suffering verbal abuse from tabloids shows why the “paps” are so hateful. He was witness to the harassment that made his Mum miserable.  To overcome his anxiety and develop self-esteem, he endured anxiety while maintaining his endearing personality. Protecting his wife and children becomes a major priority. He takes important steps for security that he feels was lacking in keeping his Mum safe.  Sharing his experiences explains the determination he has to improve mental health and veteran services.  Absolutely hold this man in high regard !"
Jabiru,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,He’s believable.,"To live your life in public is difficult. To have your life story twisted to fit someone else’s agenda must be painful. Both of these together has to be unimaginable. So Harry is trying to explain his experiences in his own words, discussing the impacts of them with both honesty and humor. I’ve been a follower of the British Royal family for a very long time so there’s few big-story surprises here. What makes the difference is the elaboration on the background by Harry, and his viewpoint, in his own words. One shouldn’t expect everyone’s memories of an event to be the same. We’re all coming from different perspectives. I find him to be honest, open, and respectful when needed. It’s helpful that his story is told in somewhat of a chronological order. The story builds. It’s easy to see the impact of previous events. I come away feeling even more sorry for him, moreso now that I read that he feels he received no real comfort when he lost his Mother. It’s a harsh book at times, but I feel it’s written with an honesty that makes the reader understand the need for it. I highly recommend this book."

Knowing that there are always two sides to any story, seeing yours with almost total clarity makes all the things we've read over the years make more sense. I always knew trash rags were just that but had no idea to that extreme. Your mother's trials with them and now yours as well as Megan's. I really do feel sorry that I as a royal follower may have inadvertently been complicit. I pray you and the ""institution"" can some day reconcile.As for the book, couldn't seem to put it down!

Jean Walker,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An interesting Biography - Well written and engaging,"This is well written and engaging.  I like the conversational style of it - like you are sitting in a pub with a pint listening to a great story.  The chronological arrangement is easy to follow, and the periodic return to several memory themes (Diana, Prince Harry and King Charles)  lends impact and relevance to more current experiences.  The section on Prince Harry's military experience might drag a bit, but as a former soldier I found it interesting.  It also relates so intimately to his final decision to seek counseling.  Overall I found the book to be believable, with Prince Harry exposing his warts along with those in and around the family."
M. James,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Courageous and searingly honest,"There has been so much comment on and criticism of Harry, of this book and of the accompanying interviews, that you have probably already formed your opinion. Which is fine, provided that you've actually read the book and watched the interviews. It is pretty clear that most of the loudest critics have not, or at least that they decided their line before they did so. It, and he, have largely been scandalously misrepresented, which really only serves to illustrate his point that the media perpetually , misrepresents him because it is in their interest to do so. Despite what you may have read, his only real criticism of his family concerns their lack of support for him and Meghan in dealing with the media, and indeed their complicity and that of palace aides in stoking it at times. It’s impossible for us to know the truth of whether they were actively complicit in media criticism, but it is very clear that they were indeed silent when he needed their vocal or legal support.Harry could have ducked many issues in this book. He could have pretended that he had never tried drugs, he could have avoided talking about his own mental health struggles, or exposing his fear for his wife’s life, could have airbrushed over the Nazi costume episode, and so on. He ducks none of it. The account is hugely exposing of himself personally, much more so than of others. And yes, it’s an entertaining read. So read it before you judge."

I think this book just gives such clarity on his life and the things he went through a the spare, the mistreatment and intrusion of the press.

Andynj,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry shares his great love for his family (all of them) and his hopes for a better future.,"The book was a great narrative by a man who obviously loves his family but is sad - and justifiably angry - about the treatment he and his wife have received from the British media and some family members. He does not trash anyone, only shares honest accounts of his feelings and the truth behind what the tabloids publish. He has “receipts” for what he includes in the book. It was nice to read about his great affection for his father and his grandparents. It is unfortunate that the only other person in the RF who could demonstrate love died in 1997, his life in the palace could have been better."
Elizabeth B.,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well done!,"The insight into life as a Royal is disturbing.  The seeds of power being corrupted is sadly visible -- after Elizabeth worked so hard to keep it in abeyence for 70 years.  And, equally, her desire to restore honor and respect for the Monarchy.  I know just enough about UK history to see potential for history repeating with a self-centered King that I'm afraid William will be.  He needs therapy just as Harry did for the same reasons.  Harry's honesty and humor, passed down from his Gran that made her so beloved, are what both Charles and William lack.  Are the paps as vicious and deceitful in the US as in the UK?"
S. Larson,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful,"I've always wished to hear Harry's story from Harry's mouth and now I have. So many things struck me about this book. His family is really no different than most, except for the fact that they are royals and that none of us know how intrusive people can be to a royal. Did it make me hate anyone? Not in the least.  Did it make me wish for better? For all of them, yes. Will I think twice about reading any article about anyone famous? Yes. I only hope that Harry and Meghan find peace, for themselves and their children. And, I hope someday they can all be together again without all the negative.

The book details Harry's life from birth prior to meeting Megan and then addresses the way they met and their life to the present.  I found the book very enlightening and interesting.  I believe the book is very truthful and to the critics who are so quick to criticize and condemn Harry and Megan for wanting to live a somewhat ""normal"" life, and want people to know the lies that have been told about them, I recommend you don't read this book, but rather stick to the Tabloids.

I wish both of them happiness and goodwill.  And - as the British would say - the Firm can just “sod off.”  I never liked Charles, who was a terrible husband, or Camilla, who didn’t think twice about breaking up two marriages - her own and Charles.’  And these two are now King and Queen of England?

Even the ones I had demonized in my own minds eye.  I found myself empathizing with what it must feel like to be ""owned"" by an institution - owned by the public.  After all, the public were paying for their very existence.  What it must feel like to have to grow up, make mistakes and be judged perhaps more harshly than those of his peers.  But I also experienced a level of sympathy for what generations of that family have had to undergo.Trauma is a major theme that wraps it's tentacles around Harry - long past childhood, it ensnares him, forms his very being.  I was surprised to learn many things about his feelings about Diana's passing, ones that would be understandable for any young man to feel, but are more so understandable after what he experienced on a world stage.  The descriptions of his feelings are so vivid, so painfully raw, that you can't help but feel for him.I have to give credit where credit is due - this book is exceptionally well written...this speaks to a very close partnership with Prince Harry's ghost writer, JR Moehringer.  I could see Prince Harry pouring over his laptop all night long, writing all his feelings down and then JR, taking those feelings and moments and creating a more aesthetically pleasing, descriptive tome.  You never feel like it isn't Prince Harry talking from his heart, but you can see where JR has been able to give such clear description, you feel like you're right there, in the battlefield with Harry - that you're walking along side him during that long walk behind his mom.  I usually find biographies exceptionally boring because they feel like a history lesson, and don't speak from the heart.  This isn't that type of book.  You feel like you're reading from his diary, a very personal and private journey he is giving us access too.  His entire life has been shown to the world, by those events were not by his choice.  THIS was his choice.  His truth.I don't want to take away from this book so I will not go into specifics because I feel like you should go into this book willing to listen - remove your preconceived notions, drop your prejudice, erase from your memory the stories told by others about him and read his truth.  Because if nothing else, why should someone else opinion of you be treated as truth, when their opinions are formed by the very people who have tried to destroy you."
Lori S,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant!! Just brilliant,"I've never been one to believe what I read, unless its an autobiography. Not in decades, anyway, I think, Diana, taught me that. Truth, Of course, is in the eye of the beholder. I believe HRH Prince Harry, much more than anyone else. As a fellow Military-person, I felt a certain level of necessary honesty, he had to give. In the military, we keep the secrets that we must embellish stories for fun, and tell only the truth for the very most important. I believe his truth outweighs the Palace's. Logic tells me that. Very well written. You're Mum is undoubtably proud, I know, I would be. Job well done. Press on, young man and young lady!"
Sandi Back,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"Prince Harry wrote an excellent book with all the feelings that needed to be expressed. I understand that there were some things he just couldn’t talk about because of his father and brother, but his candidness about the royal family, his place in it, his and Meghan’s experiences, and the damaging lies told by the press his entire life was told in a fantastic way.  Prince Harry’s and Meghan’s battles were discussed in such an honest and feeling format. I couldn’t put the book down. I’m firmly of the belief that this couple did what they had to do to survive by leaving Great Britain. Excellent read."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A touching story of suffering grief and experiencing freedom,"This is a revealing story of a child with a deep sense of loss who grew up to be a man of conviction, bravely sharing his hurts and struggles for the world to experience his pain and his redemption. So open, so honest, yet so vulnerable and fragile, this book reveals the sad dysfunction of a family who wounds its very own for selfish ambition and jealousy rather than helping someone who is struggling to survive in a hostile world. May Harry and Meghan and their children find peace and safety in their new life and not look back with regret at their leavetaking from a toxic family and press. Keep looking forward to freedom!"
pillyforpumas,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling and honest.,"What I read about was a very sensitive boy being raised in a family where one child was elevated to special significance and one was not.  Harry was born to parents who were damaged goods, Charles especially.He suffered a tragic and very public loss at a young age and received not emotional support.  He longed for healing but instead suffered alone and with a ""stiff upper lip"".  His only comfort was the military.  It's all so very sad.  Just because you are born into unimaginable wealth doesn't mean you are immune to suffering. He found his love and life and America and I wish him a long happy life with his family.I thought the book was very well written, entertaining and informative."
K. ,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A sensitive and compassionate life story,"I've just begun reading this book so I cannot comment on its entire content.  From what I've read thus far, the book is written in a sensitive and thoughtful manner and communicates an honest demeanor.  I am not a follower of the royal family, nor of Prince Harry - but I bought this book upon recognizing signs that this was someone who has been through and is still processing his traumas.  I partly think the PR and news about this book shouldn't be around some agenda to take down the royal family, but a recognition that Prince Harry is a whole being with real struggles that many people can relate to.  Anyone who has experienced and survived dysfunctional and abusive surroundings know that the only way to defeat one's abusers is to live a good life outside of their world of influence.  Telling one's story is part of the healing process."
LucMee,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a screed…a letter…a deep one.,"Contrary to all the hype, this book isn’t a vengeful screed meant to tear down the monarchy. It’s a heartfelt letter to the King and the Prince of Wales. Exactly as it states in the foreword…”here it is”…It’s Harry’s way of saying the words he couldn’t find in that last despairing confrontation with his father and his brother.It would be the greatest of shames if those two don’t read this book from cover to cover, and to simply believe the press accounts. By reading this book, they’ll know. Without doubt…Without question. Exactly where they stand in Harry’s life.The one inescapable truth that this book brought to the fore for me personally, was that that family…that ancient, hidebound in formality family…could…would…without doubt…benefit immensely from learning to hug one another."
alexis,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,outstanding self reflection,"I have enjoyed reading his story in his own words. For years so many others have reported on him. Now he can tell his truth. He covered every aspect of his life. He didn’t shy away from digging into his grief, realizing he needed help. Correcting lie after lie or a spin that was told about his life. Even though him and his brother are not on good terms, he still painted a good picture of the trauma they went through and navigated. His brother had his own battles with the press and family leaking against him. I love as we wade through hard to read times, there is joy as well."
Geoff Whitwell,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,a fascinating insightful read,"I have to own up to always being a fan of Prince Harry. Up till reading this I thought Prince William might be the redeeming light in the Windsor dynasty. But alas, I think not now. Yes there are two sides to every story but this side is believable and the world has seen what the Palace and newspapers have done to different members of the royal family over the years. I felt great sorrow and happiness at different times throughout my reading, and can only wish Harry and his family a bright and happy future away from the bitterness of the Royal Family.  Whether you are a supporter or not it is a good read."
Mildred,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exquisite!!! It’s Everything!,"It’s every question you ever had in a nutshell! I had no idea Harry was such a marvelous writer. His descriptions are beautifully mastered, he’s detail but not overly so. The scenes are well written so you picture them as if you were there and the emotions he felt are truly expressed. Whether you agree or disagree with the course he’s on at this moment, you can’t argue with the fact that his story is told perfectly in this book. Well worth the read! I also purchased the audible narration since it was done by him and it was as if he was personally telling me his story himself! It’s a gem! All of it"
Dorté Zuckerman,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A MOST POETIC AND HONEST STORY,"As a published author I find Spare a most riveting and page-turning memoir. Very different from what I had expected. Deeply philosophical and poetic thoughts mix with humor, sarcasm and utter honesty.Harry grows up in a gilded cage as he experiences the loss of his mother. His story reveals private details interwoven with military service in war, as well as exotic travels in Africa. Harry’s daring honesty about a dysfunctional royal family, the harassment by the press and the resulting emotional problems are  transcribed to the reader in sincerely felt ways.I respect him for breaking free and wish him good luck with his own beautiful family!"
Abi,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,"Given the mixed press and salacious headlines, I anticipated reading this only to be in the cultural flow. However, it was a compelling read! Yes, you can tell there is hurt and some animosity behind the words...but it is not a malicious voice. This is someone wrestling, questioning, and trying to do better. There is an underlying desperation to be heard and truly seen on his own terms. Some parts are biting and feel unkind, but they feel real - like someone working through years of trauma and still on their journey. It is a human struggle, even if couched in privilege and literal royalty. This book feels so raw and unexpectedly relatable."
Estanis Herrera,Reviewed in Spain on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy entretenido y bien escrito,"Lo que más me a gustado es que Harry me hace sentir como su colega de aventuras y me enseña sin entrar en muchos detalles como es la vida real desde dentro y desde su punto de vista y no el de la prensa.La memoria está muy bien narrada y de principio a fin te deja con ganas de más, solamente al leer las dos primeras páginas pensé wow Harry puede escribir de esta manera.Le recomiendo este libro a quien tenga interés por la casa real británica,por Harry o simplemente para quién quiera pasar unas 6 horas entretenido."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Most Excellent Read,"At times reading this book I wanted to scream at the ""Royal"" family. How can they allow people into their lives who do everything they can to malign one of their own?As for the British 'press'.....how can they live with themselves spreading lies and half-truths, while endangering lives?After finishing this book in 2 1/2 days, I feel for Prince Harry. He did his duty to his country, then was criticized for what he did as a soldier. He fell in love with his soul-mate and did everything to protect her before making the choice to put her and his family first. I say cudoes to him and wish him the best."
Sandra F,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compelling reading, so sad it's fact not fiction","I'm all in favour of a free press, one that reports facts, challenges and holds people to account but I'm against press that lies, fabricates, bullies, twists and manipulates.Harry's telling of his story is compelling and shocking... how the press' bizarre ""agreement"" with the Royal Family/Palace has been abused and is well passed its sell by date.Harry comes across as very honest, open and human in his writing;choosing family over institution... putting the well-being of his little family unit over duty to ""it"" and yet still wanting to respect and serve that institution, HAD he been allowed to. Instead it appears he's been thrown under a bus.As he says ""it didn't have to be this way"".He reached out repeatedly for help for him and his wife for years, only to be told ""ignore it/it's just the way it is""... until he was desperate and brave enough to take on the system and say ENOUGH.Everyone knows you shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers and Harry gets his story across in a very convincing and heart rending way.I hope he's right in what he believes, that one day Charles and William will see how he was right and regret not standing with him and saying ENOUGH. Standing up to the press would have benefitted them too.A must read."
Rob Kirkand,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read for men like me,"I don’t know what I expected before reading this book. I have never been one to care about the gossip and feuds of the British Monarchy.But there is something that drew me to this book. Maybe it was Diana. Maybe it was Harry’s military service. Maybe I wanted to see behind the curtain. What is fame like?Whatever the reason, I am a better man for having read this book. The importance of hard work, serving others and your country, protecting your family, and speaking truth are some of my main takeaways.All men who are stuck in life would benefit from reading this."
A. M.,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"Loved this. My mother was a Princess Diana fan and thus, I have had a vague interest in the royals for most of my life. I have personally read the hateful comments made by random people on various social media posts regarding the Duke and Duchess - and I was not shocked, but always disgusted.I read Spare because this young family’s struggles resonated with me from a mental health perspective. I admire both Harry and Meghan’s strength and courageousness in being able to openly and truthfully share their side of the story. I support them, and will always be a fan of their ability to shine a light on that which others would prefer to keep in the dark."
Harmony Kent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exquisite Writing,"This memoir hooked me from the first page and did not let go.I cannot begin to imagine being forced to live this kind of life from childhood and on through those angst-filled teenage years—where it’s hard enough to find your self-identity—and then into young adulthood, where more of the same crap interrupts both your career choices and any chance of a true and enduring romantic relationship.As I don’t take the tabloid press seriously, I don’t read them, so the events shared herein came as an eye-opening shock. I’d known things were bad for Harry, then for Harry and Meghan, but had no clue just how dire and awful and unforgivable.Having lived through Diana’s death and the whole Charles/Camilla debacle, I thought I was prepared for some of the antics of the royal family and ‘the establishment’, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Neither could I have guessed at the depth of the depravity of the British press nor the complicity of ‘the palace’.This memoir addresses tough issues such as suicide and depression and drug taking with raw honesty, which I feel will help many people who have found themselves feeling isolated and with no way out. It’s wonderful to, finally, read an honest and personal account that gives the facts rather than the appalling fictions doled out to the public over too many years.A must read for anyone interested in the truth.***NOTE ON RATINGS: I consider a 3-star rating a positive review. Picky about which books I give 5 stars to, I reserve this highest rating for the stories I find stunning and which moved me.5 STARS: IT WAS AMAZING! I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! — Highly Recommended.4 STARS: I WOULD PULL AN ALL-NIGHTER — Go read this book.3 STARS: IT WAS GOOD! — An okay read. Didn’t love it. Didn’t hate it.2 STARS: I MAY HAVE LIKED A FEW THINGS —Lacking in some areas: writing, characterisation, and/or problematic plot lines.1 STAR: NOT MY CUP OF TEA —Lots of issues with this book."
Cindy,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to hear his truth not the medias game-man-ship or the Piers Morgan hater,"First, may I say that in my book the media is the worst ill in this world. Piers Morgan has ulterior motives with his rages and hate. The media pull strings and lie and ruin lives. I am sorry Prince Harry has had to resort to this to make sure he is heard not interpreted. I love his candor and his love of the two women in his life that mean so much to him and his children. I continue to be shocked by the lengths the royal family have gone to Undermind him and his wife Meghan. I think much wreck and ruin is behind the throne. The power behind the throne which have bound together to throw Harry to the wolves. The ones that work for the royals. I keep thinking how much Princess Diana suffered from similar people and would be so unhappy that her boys whom she doted on are now so estranged. The book is a good read. It is sad but noteworthy of how they were just given the I don't care what happens to you attitude when it all was going sideways. Meghan is a strong personality and has had to fight for recognition probably due to her mixed race, so I don't think she took it well having people be condescending to her. So, she rubbed some the wrong way, but I think it was mutual. She's American and a free soul and being pushed to the back of everything must have been hard. Protocol royal style not easy and not sure they have given her much help learning. Throw you in the deep end and swim seems to be much of what has gone on, but people drown that way too. I want William to have the film pulled from his eyes and see his brother again as he is his brother someone his mother wanted him to love and stand by not be caught up into the morass of the royal lock step attitude. This book needed to be written to set it straight what is in Harry's mind. Remember the media hounded Diana and eventually had a part in her death by driving her like an animal they were in hunt for. Keep up the good fight Prince Harry don't let the bustards win and destroy your lovely family."
I&MWilson,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a heartfelt account of his life.,"I approached the book with an open mind and found it heartfelt and engaging. It's hectic at times with lots of background stories and side stories all told simultaneously, as it gives the feeling that the author, Prince Harry, had been holding back for such a long time, that sometimes it all just comes as an avalanche. But it gives a good view of what he experienced throughout the years. This is his story and he is in his right to tell it. I did not find it malicious or revengeful, especially towards his father, ""Pa and darling boy"" is mostly a sweet story, and not significantly different from what we experience with our parents, they have their flaws and limitations, and our stories are never perfect. There are juicy bits, which the media has done quite a job spinning (probably to deflect its own damaging part in his story) but, in reading it in the context, it just shows how the structure in which they all live is not conducive to familial love and emotional health. And there is the loss of his mother, all around, so encompassing and devasting. I lost my father when I was nine years old, so I can relate to that shattering moment when nothing will ever be the same, and that who you are (and were to be) is forever changed. There is no life of privilege that can protect you from the most profound pain of losing a parent at such a young age."
Shirley Bruce,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His point of view,I rarely leave reviews. I don't know anything about the royal family in fact I said I would never buy this book. Who cares about them? But watching an interview it picked my interest. I really like that this is the first time I'm learning about the royal family about Harry and Megan. It was a very honest book. Why ppl is saying he is destroying his family? He only spoke good about his family. Omg ppl take things way out of context. Don't read the summaries don't read the few sentences read the whole book learn the truth and you too will fall in love with this amazing human being.
Carol A. Arrell,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good read!,"I enjoyed Harry’s story.  I lived through it all, so I knew some of it.  Some of it was new.  Despite all the criticism, I get Harry, and I get his frustration with the media and press.  Here in America, we have a press that lies and twists, destroying people’s lives.  The press is heartless, discriminating, holds so much power over people’s beliefs.  Nothing is sacred to them.  I sincerely hope that he finds peace, and love throughout the rest of his life.  Everyone survives the death of a loved one differently.  Some of us don’t survive at all.  Happy life, Harry!"
RockyGirl,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating!,"Well written, very informative.  A bit too much info regarding private parts and frost bite!  Not sure why that wasn’t edited out.  Otherwise, feels very honest, truthful.  I doubt the family will ever reunite, but at least it might modernize....hopefully.  The institution is flawed and severely outdated.  We’ve all known how dysfunctional that family is, has been for decades.  William and Kate provided hope, but if what Harry relates is true, William has anger issues and Kate can be quite petty and snobbish.  That was disappointing to read.  America is a far better fit for Harry and Meghan and their children.  I wish them well."

I never felt “sorry” for him, but after this read: I understand him now.If you’re expecting tons of “palace secrets” this isn’t the book for you. But, if you’re looking to better understand the Monarchy, as a “company” and Family, I would recommend reading. Some stories weren’t shared with the public until this book, and some were left out.

Lover of Mysteries,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry's Truth,"I watched the Investiture as a 12 year old.  I watched Charles introduce Lady Diana. His response told me he did not love her.  I knew nothing of a Camilla.  I watched Harry and Meghan on Netflix several times to see and feel all I could.  The Queen I felt did not control her life.  The Monarchy was powerful staff.  When I was 25 and having a difficult decision about my future, I asked myself a question about power.  I rejected power in support of my heart and my decision about my life direction.  When we saw pictures of Diana and her boys, we liked the impish Prince. When we saw Will keep Catherine on a string for years, we wondered about him.  It was fate that brought Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.  I felt Lady Diana smiled from the heavens and told Harry to follow his heart, protect your family, the Monarchy let it go.  Be serene.  Enjoy your life.  Best to the Mounbatten-Windsor  family. Archie and Lilibet, you have great parents and a fabulous Grandma in Doria  Ragland."
chilly flamingo,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"The book was extremely well written, either by Prince Harry himself, or with the assistance of a ghost writer. Much of the writing almost seemed poetic to me. There were some passages that I found tough to read. Primarily love, frustration, and anger take center stage, and I expect this will become a well referenced historical book of the Royal Family. The book provides interesting insight into a family of regular normal people, much like members in our own families, who live their lives in a fish bowl of institutional restraints. I have respect for the royal family members, however, I would never wish to trade places with them."

But moreover,Harry has had a life filled with sadnesses he did not understand so he carried them with him everysingle day.  The book details the unhappy events of his life - the divorce of his parents, the deathof his mother and the insensitive way he was treated by his family and the British press.  When hemet Megan, he found a kindred spirit - someone who cared about who he is and what makes him tick.After much therapy, marriage, two children of his own, he tells his story openly without apology."
Andrew Fristed,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must read!,"This book is a must read for anyone who has lost a parent too soon.  I lost my dad suddenly at age 20, Dad was going to divorce my mom but hey Mom got lucky and he died.  Like Harry  my Mom (Charles) had a side piece for YEARS and we were all supposed to play along like it was normal.  Looking back, how unhealthy was that?  I mean, this man showed up at my wedding nine years later in a tux and people thought he was my dad.  Wanted to cry and cringe all at once.  Anyway, I am team Harry 100%.  Be a dad, be a husband and life your best life in California.  Ironically, my two sons have, almost, the same birthdays as William and Harry!  My younger one is a week before Willam.  Harry is very much Diana's son.  People want to make Kate into Diana 2.0 but Meghan is very much Diana 2.0, or Meg 1.0 with her humanitarian work.  Good for Harry for breaking free from an unhealthy family.  BRF are entitled boring people who live in insane wealth that they have not earned.  William has anger issues, Kate comes off as a bit boring.  I recommend The Palace Papers as well.  When my mom died there was talk about putting her ashes in my dad's grave.  Hmmmm when he was alive he walked through the room and she gave him the middle finger?  And OPENLY was unfaithful for 3-4 years?  Hard no from me.  And she will never go there.  Great quick read."

I've always liked Prince Harry but didn't know much about him.  After reading this book, I don't know how anyone could live a life like that and come out sane.  Family should be there for you when you need them, not turn their back on you.  Seeing the love that Harry and Meghan have for each other and their 2 children makes me happy.  At least he has someone in his corner because it looks like his family certainly isn't.  They just want to live a normal happy life and isn't that what we all want?"
Precious,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much I thought I already knew...,"Congrats Prince Harry, job well done! I just started yesterday already enthralled. I caught myself going ahead wanting to see how that event/incident ended. (🙋🏽‍♀️ Ms. Impatient.) Considering the fact that both his parents wrote biographies and conducted many interviews abt their experiences growing up/living all things Royal, I don't understand why ppl are poo-poo'ing Harry for capturing his memoirs. Best to hear things from him than from unnamed sources twice removed who don't know squat.I haven't come to the part where Harry calls his parents names like aloof, absent, cold, domineering, abusive, like chuck did in his biography. (Sorry if these weren't the exact adjectives he used, it has been a while. He was brutal on PP though).I like what I've read thus far and the flow. (Yes, I've read ahead seeking out specific topics. I'll go back to the beginning'ish in a bit. 😁)"

He was brave to take on the Paparazzi in this wonderful educational revealing book of truth, which has set the record straight for him and Megan.It must have been very therapeutic for Harry to have released this book straight from his heart, which also shows so much love and promise for a life now free of royal restraints with their children growing up in love.

So glad I did; what I found most interesting was the horrible actions of the press, particularly the paparazzi, and the inner workings of the royal family colluding with the press by choosing some of themlike Harry and Meghan as scapegoats. Very disturbing!Harry has led an interesting life and the writing here does an excellent job of showing all his life experiences and choices. Kudos to Harry. Wishing you and your family a beautiful life."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Family, Not a Firm","Whatever you expect, this is not a book of revenge or “whinging.” Harry truthfully shares a life shattered in childhood and his struggle toward wholeness, where he can finally create a real family. The Firm is a business in which each individual becomes less human and those, who are able to maintain authenticity, are viewed with suspicion and scapegoated and fed to the Press in a corrupt and soul destroying bargain. The Press prints rumors, lies, and outright slander and the Firm tolerates, no uses, this to create a system of binaries—good prince/bad prince, English Rose/American ‘actress.’ None of these are real. But very convenient. It is at the Press, he directs his scorn and hatred. Quite rightly.His mother, Diana’s, a complex real person, absence is felt on every page. Her death a result of the Press.In some ways this is a real tragedy. He and his father and brother talk at each other, not with each other. The father never able to see or understand that “darling boy” is now a person and unable to understand what that person needs from them. The two brothers struggle to understand why the Firm is so incapable of sustaining a Family.This is a moving read. I highly recommend the audible where you can Harry’s wonderful narration."
Lisa K,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly thoughtful and moving.,"My curiosity got the best of me and I bought this book to settle some questions I had given the intense media coverage Harry and Megan have had these past few years.  This book does more than put my curiosity to rest.  It reframes my view of Harry and that of the royal family. He steps off the page fully formed, admitting to his faults and mistakes as well as sharing the lessons he's learned along the way.  I was surprised by some of what I read but as the story evolved his past laid the groundwork for how things ended.  In the end, I find I admire Harry and commend him for his strength of character.  Not many could walk away from the life of privilege he grew up with and from all accounts he seems to be the better for leaving it all behind."
Helen L Goodman,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read,"Very much enjoyed this book. It was unexpectedly emotional to me…at times made me laugh out loud, and at other times it made me cry. In line with the themes of this book’s narrative, I didn’t find this book to be nearly as “tea spilling” as the earlier media portrayals. It did share much of Harry’s thoughts and feelings but he certainly didn’t tell crazy tales about specific family members…and one has no doubt that he could have.I was very touched about his thoughts about his involvement in the military and the Invictus games.His grief for his beloved “Mummy” was overwhelming…as is his love for his wife and children."
SB,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant and honest!,"This book will make you laugh and cry, sometimes in the same paragraph! It’s thoughtfully written and will have you turning the pages long into the night. Don’t just read the excerpts in the press, most are taken out of context. This is not a revenge book or a bashing of the royal family (far from it) but an honest and raw account of a young boy growing into a man in a highly disfunctional family and with the weight of heavy trauma associated with losing his beloved mother at such a tender age! Whether you’re a fan of Harry or not, you should take the time to read his story, from his mouth, and then make your own mind up, don’t let the tabloids make your mind up for you. I wish H,M,A & L all the best for a future (G&P too). They made the right and only choice…"
Tommy VanEtten,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sad commentary on life,"This book is well written and sad in many ways.  You see, Prince Harry and his family are human and flawed just as every man and woman on the planet.  Each of us experience some kind of dysfunction based on our humanity.  I think it is wrong for the Prince or any of us to air in a public way the fractured nature of most families.  I'll leave that up to God knowing full well I will receive the same scrutiny from my Creator.  This book is a shameful example of revenge.  It is important to realize that Love and Resentment cannot occupy the same Real Estate."
Lorrie E. Riemer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very introspective detail of point of view,The book brought a sense of how much the news media hurts people.  How the media creates conflict in families.  I am saddened by how the media creates a distance  in a family that has survived so many trials and tribulations throughout time.  I hope that Harry and Meghan find peace with their family.  At some point I hope the outer family are able to come together  yet I believe Harry has made a move to keep his love safe.  Good for you  May the families find connection and love away from the media
lady W,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Read,"I loved this book on so many levels, but mainly because of the unfiltered honesty and funny self depreciating humour that Harry brought to his story.He was really rather gracious in all his stories about his family. He somehow managed to make me like them in spite of their flaws.This was a wild and crazy journey through the reality of life as a royal and in sone ways it was like reading Alice in Wonderland because of the strangeness of their lives.No matter how they all feel about his book the world is cheering him on and loves him better for it."

Penne1798,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A powerful narrative but, not the only one.","What I found most interesting about this book is that most,  if not all of the negative stories and quotes about this book in the media prior to its launch in the UK were completely wrong.  All it did was highlight the fact that the media will do ANYTHING for a headline. The Caroline Flack quote was a prime example.  He did not say she was ""his bit of rough"", he merely stated that that is what the newspapers said at the time and how much it upset her and how ridiculous it was. He addresses many of the jibes leveled at him over the years and his hatred of the media and journalists is evident on almost every page. I do not take all of it as gospel truth but,  he has made his point and it is a powerful one. I wish him well but,  I hope he doesn't write a further book because it will just keep dragging on and on."
Lila Sude,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!,"Bravo to Harry; such a great example of true courage! This is truly a David and Goliath story. He and his wife are two amazingly authentic,  intelligent, caring and compassionate human beings which the world (and the Royals) need more of. An excellent book, very well written, and a magnificent behind-the-scenes account of what it’s like to grow up in the English monarchy; nothing like the fairy tales many of us were brought up on; instead a very sad, lonely and frightening existence for any child (and especially the spare). Well done; a very fascinating read. Hang in there, Harry! America loves you both!"

There is a part of you that doesn’t want to feel sorry for him given his privilege but I could not help feeling, as a mother, how proud Diana would be of him and the life he is building. A family. Something that seems to have evaded him growing up. He’s made mistakes, he’s owned up to them (can anyone deny they’ve made mistakes…out in the British-press, open wide?). He strives for something that finally, lovingly, May have made it worth it. I enjoyed this book, more than I thought I would, and would highly recommend this book. Well done, darling boy!"

I also see the wounded child grow into a still wounded, angry young man who needed help to over come mental and emotional health issues.  These issues are close to my heart.  This is a piece also allowed me to see the growth of a young boy into a young man through his service to his country, and further through his continue service even today.

ResqRN2113,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible insight,"As with many people, I was curious as to the back story involving Harry. We have only seen, or heard, the story from the British press. Now we can hear his side. There are always 2 sides to any story, but his has been buried and now have come to light. Harry has always been straight forward and has paid the price with rumors and false articles. I know this will be a shock to the Royal Family, but after years of denying him a voice, he now has presented his side. The book was a easy read, full of vivid descriptions and antidotes, as seen from his side. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope he and his family can finally have peace."

It didn’t long to hear the heart break in Harry’s voice. I’ve watched him grow up over the years from afar in the US. I felt so awful for both him and William. No child should have to endure the loss of a parent at such a young age. Life, however, sometimes has different plans for us.  I know all about that having lost my husband to leukemia. I hope Harry will read the positive reviews of his book and know that we(people who care) send our love to him, Megan, Archie, and Lillibet! I highly recommend this book to anyone."

Not only am I happy Prince Harry and his family now live in the USA...it encouraged me to realize how happy and a privilege to live in the USA.I , suppose, not being born into the royalty and ""the life"" I cannot imagine living in this ""mean spirited "" arrangement, where it seems Prince Harry's family is so happy NOT to be in the public's eye themselves, of hateful distain and ridicule , that they quietly walk away and pretend not to notice what is occurring.Stay with us ,Harry and let your family enjoy the personal freedom of America!"
YH,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,He had to write it.,"If you’ve read the book, you’d understand why Prince Harry felt the need to write it. If you haven’t read it but continue to be a harsh, negative and a grumpy critique of H&M, well then you’re just an uninformed hater. This book is well written to be the point where you can hear Prince Harry’s voice in it. I wish nothing but the best for them. As for the institution and his family within the institution, the picture he has painted seems rather hopeless. In that aspect, he really has nothing to lose in stepping away but much more to gain."
C. Brandt,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare,"At first when reading this book, I thought that Prince Harry was an over indulged, whiney big baby.  But, the further I got into the book, the more I realized that Prince Harry and Meghan were totally harassed, lied to, demeaned and scandalized by the so called British Tabloid press who thinks it is okay to make stories up just to sell to gullible Brits and make money.  The things his family has done to discredit him and Meghan breaks my heart.  To me the British Monarchy should be given the old boot. The Brits don't need to contribute money to their ill behavior, their entitlement."
Luke,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compulsive Read,"What surprised me the most was the great writing (love the Shakespeare allusions). What surprised me the least given the vitriol the British tabloids love to spew was the fact that every leaked headline from the book was taken out of context (the false tabloid claims that Harry ""boasted"" about killing 25 Taliban were particularly egregious). It was also fascinating to read Harry admit to ""decades of being rigorously and systematically infantilized"" - seriously, the system didn't let him grow up. Harry recognizes the ridiculousness of being a 30-something-year-old and being financially cut off - he knows no one is going to feel sorry for him - and yet it's his truth. Writing a book was about all he could do to take care of his family. (Unfairly) Meghan has been made the villain, but I think Spare sets the record straight. Catherine and William would do well to take note, or we will be hearing a Spare sequel from one of the younger Cambridges in 20 years time."
A reader,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very real.,"I just finished reading “Spare”. I sensed the Diana I remember coming to life thru Prince Harry. I sensed the very real historical inter generational trauma … the emotional tones Diana revealed as a young wife and Mom that probably had their genesis in the days of her own childhood, amid stories of real family discord… divorce and an absent Mother.  I was not surprised in reading how fundamentally big his Mom’s life -and death - were in all he did.His portrayal of combat… and PTSD… his own struggles… believable.I think his portrayal of the ancient, dysfunctional family is accurate… especially when examining how scapegoating, narcissism and other very real family challenges are considered.The good thing for Harry and Meghan… they are free to build a real life for their children.There are most assuredly parts in this book that could be used to describe PTSD, family dysfunction, institutional betrayal, scapegoating and more. If anything, this book is a primer on how each and every one of us always exist along a spectrum of emotional calm. Even with all the money that the Crown has… they can experience trauma… even with castles and gold and …"

If anyone doubts his story, just look at how the British Tabloids have taken over social media in the US.  Every other story is about how everyone is turning on them.  That is all false narrative.  They cannot escape the hate.  Keep telling your truths.  The Royals in UK are destroying themselves by being so pious.  They need to apologize and try to show some humanity.

I was really moved by Harrys concern and reaching out to war veterans. The forgotten héroes by those who have never fought in battle themselves.  The pressure Megan is under is astounding and very unfair.  Harry has always impressed me as a geniune person, so hard to come by.

Very topical!,"So firstly, I'm not a big fan of non-fantasy/sci-fi so this is not my preferred genre of book! Let's keep that in mind. I would normally give it a 4*, but what bumped it up to me is how topical it was.I enjoyed it. I thought it was raw at times (chapter 84 I believe if was had me in tears). The ending was adorable. Didn't like some of the sappy parts, but that's just me.I find it was very accurate in its portrayal of the press. Seeing the Ndileka Mandela/Live to Lead saga that the tabloids manufactured led me to write this review. It just affirmed a lot of what is in there.I came away sympathising with the author,  having more insight and wanting to know more.

owl_of_the_night,Reviewed in Germany on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The title should be ""traitor""","The title of this book should be ""traitor"" because that is what Harry does in this book - betraying his family for money. He and his wife should be stripped of all royal titles for all the heartbreak they cause the Royal Family, unfortunately not just behind the scenes.Harry grew up in - for normal people - unimaginable riches and luxury, having all riches,, servants who did all for him and being surrounded by priceless art, living in castles, never having to work for his bills, but he is just complaining about everything, envious of the (now) Prince of Wales, and throwing his brother, his sister in law, The King and The Queen Consort just under the bus.Instead of whinning that his mother died as he was 12 (nearly 13) he should be thankfull that he had nearly 13 years a mother who loved him dearly.If you could look over all the self pitty and whinning this book, and you don't care that you support with the buying of the book cold hearted people, who will become the most detested people on the planet, the book gives you interesting, never heard of insights, e.g. the interior of Balmoral. For that I give the book 2 stars.For what he did to his family he should be stripped of all royal titles (as there is nothing royal on him now after spilling all the beans, what includs describing his private parts), he should have to live in an normal appartment with 70 m² or so and have to work for his living, e.g. at an assembly line (hopefully that that is something he can do without making a mess out of it, as he does in the book with his time in the army) and live by his wages for the rest of his life."

So I always felt a sense of kinship and admiration for her, even though of course I didn’t personally know her.

Jane Miller,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read the book,"I am an American who lived in London for several years.  I don't think those who live outside of the UK really understand what British media is like and the relationship it has with the ""Firm"" and the Royal Family. The Royal family is incredibly insulated.  They cover and close ranks to protect their brand.  Often a family member is a sacrificial lamb so that the heirs are protected from scandal or negative imagery. They are whipping boys, use to redirect negativity from other family members.This book isn't an attack on the Royal family, although I am sure they see it that way.  It is a memoire.  It spells out what it is like to be ""the spare.""  It details the horrendous treatment Harry and Meghan received at the hands of the media and the family's indifference to their suffering.  Overall, it is incredibly sad.  The Crown has repeatedly sacrificed family members on its altar.  The huge bureaucracy that is the firm, aids, enables and abets it.Harry reminds me of a person who has escaped from a cult.  The cult members don't understand why he had to leave. He hopes that eventually they will see the light.Harry is incredibly honest.  He reveals himself, warts and all. His time in the military reveals a great deal about his character.Ignore everything you've seen in the media and read the book.  Draw your own conclusions."

I admire, thank and respect him for his truth, his service, and his dedication to his wife and family. Standing up to the lies/press had to be unbearably courageous. Bravo Prince Harry and Megan.

It reminded me of Princess Margaret’s life, in that there was no role for her within the royal family.  In so many ways Harry was trapped by his role in, and demands of the family.  The lack of empathy for his position was amazing, but not surprising considering the history of protectiveness for the crown.The papers in the UK were shocking!  The fact members of the family fed them stories to protect other family members was shocking. The fact that his father pulled their funds after stoping their security was shocking!This was no great piece of literature, but it held my interest.  I confess to being a fan of Prince Harry and Megan’s.  I wish them the best."

Once you start reading it you can't put it down and hearing Harry narrating is the best of all.  People who criticize this book have not read it because this man truly loves his family. His special relationship with his grandmother and his hurt from losing his mother at such a young age will make you think twice. This is a beautiful book and I am so glad he wrote it. I hope at some point the Royal Family can be as transparent is this. And now he has freedom.

I feel like I know Harry so we’ll….it’s like he’s a friend now. I found him to be honest, warm, his words so real and compelling. I’ve watched him grow up over the years, and to see him telling his story so profoundly…..I just feel so proud of him. The book was written as if he’s speaking to the reader personally, a style that totally resonates with me. I was angry, I laughed, and I cried, especially at the end. I’m always happy after reading a book that brings out every emotion I have. I will so recommend this book to everyone I can. It’s time well spent. So proud of Harry…..I adore him."
Waffles The Cat,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry had the courage to walk away from generational dysfunction,"More touching and quite a bit sadder than I would have imagined going in. I thought it would be ""just"" an autobiography, but it's much more. Harry has important things to say about family, dysfunction, and taking steps to fix your life and the lives of the next generation.The BRF is incredibly dysfunctional; it creates unhappy, damaged people who live in unimaginable luxury and wealth that they didn't earn. They have a sick, destructive, Faustian relationship with the press. They're literally willing to destroy their family members for good press coverage, and Prince Harry is far from the only victim. The tabloids hurt people of all walks of life, and are like acid eating away at civility and community, putting their targets against everyone else.Reading about Harry's like, it struck me that the idea of deciding what a child's life will be like with no input from the child living that life, based only on that child's birth order is insane. Children in the BRF are groomed to benefit their families over themselves to the point that they have to get permission to marry. They can't have interests that lead to jobs outside of the ""family"". As small children, they're sent away from their parents to school, but expected to never leave as adults.The entire system is sick and warped. The idea that a person who never asked for it must sacrifice their life so that their family can live in palaces is warped. This is a system that cannot produce healthy adults.The fact that Harry walked away and set his own course is nothing short of amazing. He's brave for getting help for his grief and for the warped way he was raised.Sometimes bravery is telling the plain truth and letting the chips fall where they may. This is one of those times. I've read many in the media saying that this is airing dirty laundry. Why should an abused person have to hide?Good on Harry for his courage, strength, and willingness to live a healthy life on his own terms."
Nicole,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, captivating read.","I have not finished reading this book yet, but I can say that I am heartbroken for the boy who lost his mother, his foundation, his friend.  This isn't the salacious tell-all that people were expecting, but a look at the moments who helped define the man that he we see today.  He focuses on the events and the people who helped guide him as a parent would, into becoming someone HE can be proud of.We can take pieces of anything and make it look worse than it is, and I will say that I was influenced and expected to be disappointed by the book, but I am enjoying seeing a young Harry navigate his way in this world, without a real sense of belonging because people in his world only saw his as a ""spare"".  While he has mentioned that his family and people around him did not find him to be ""smart"", you can clearly see that this is an intelligent human being who is finding his identity and his place in the world, and just wants to be accepted by, and loved by, his family for who he is as a person, and not as a royal."
Pamela ,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Read’s like personal correspondence,"Preordered and worth the read. Not what I expected at all. Missing the salutation & closing, this is one long letter that glosses over many items and is more focused on his love of life in the army and challenges/accomplishments there. Including a few items to illustrate how diabolical The Firm is (no shocker there) intentionally feeding the tabloid’s material. Not a single “bombshell” yet after what was done to his mum, how could he possibly have blind faith in The Firm? He could have revealed so much more than he did yet his hopes for reconciliation are evident in his loyalty and love for The Royals.  Truly sad that Charles’s blatant envy for the love of Diana still haunts them all. THAT is the root of all the present pain."

The level of lies startled and shocked me from even the smallest detail to huge revelations. I have the feeling that Harry was much kinder than the Royal family and staff deserved. I so enjoyed the intricate details he included in his descriptions, and his ""talking to you"" writing style. His military experiences were so telling and such a part of his healing process. But his stories of Megan and their courtship was so obviously a man in love. Then having their children together to give him all he ever wanted in life. I believe his mum guided him. I thought Charles was a better father than initially thought, until the pulling of security on his son and grandchild.  That is unforgivable. I am so grateful that Harry has broken free, and I pray they remain free. I worry about Archie and Lilibet. I hope he will be able to protect them. I believe that telling his truth is to protect them"
Diane O'bannon,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written with the ring of truth,"This is a fabulously written (with a ghost) honest book by a very thoughtful person about his life. A prince, stuck in an impossible situation for any energetic striving man: you can't say or do anything without permission from at least three other people who rule your life. The crazy-making royal ""corporation"" adds another layer of mis-communication and frustration to life not to mention the active evil of the press. I say bravo to Harry and Meghan for making it out. Best to them and the loving family they want to - and are - creating."
DnJPeg,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Painful view of a sad family,"A heartbreaking look into such a dysfunctional family history. I have always felt a warm spot for Harry and am glad he was able to find the love of his life, and so sorry that his family showed themselves to be their true selves and how the institution of the monarchy molded his father and brother into cold and unfeeling, jealous men. I always admired his mother, and admire Harry and Meg even more now, regardless of the vicious press, even here in the US. His family will never forgive him for painting this picture of them. Great book. Sad story, but well written."
Laura Hill,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cant put it down,"This man has had an amazing and sad life. The writing is exquisite, makes you feel like you are in all the places right next to Harry, witnessing his life and emotions. My take aways, Charles was a good father as best as he could be, William is a twat who is jealous and has always thought he was above Harry. The press is the USA is NOTHING like UK and people here do not put up with press abusing Celebs. All in all I cant give this enough stars, buy it, you wont regret it."
MafiaMom,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Historical Document and Classic That Reveals 20th and 21st Century English Monarchy,"Prince Harry, for the first time, has written a historical autobiographical document and English language classic of life within the English Monarchy that reveals operations of the 20th and  21st Century English Monarchy, and in so doing, reveals the current state, as well as the 20th and 21st Century English Monarchy within the context of history.So, for the first time in history, we have an indelible and inescapable first-person historical account of 5 generations of life (Queen Mother, Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry, and their children) all inside the English Monarchy in the 20th and 21st centuries."
Lynn Reeves,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fairness,"I’ve waffled in my opinion of Prince Harry over the last year.  Especially due to the “fact” that he “blindsided the queen” with his leaving his royal duties.  I thought much less of him because of this, but I felt in all fairness, I was obligated to read his side of the story - and found it very credible.  He freely admits to his past misdeeds and drug use, leading even more credence to his other claims.  I recommend others read this book to get a better idea of what’s really going on."
Fiore_Sh,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"wow, what a great read","I loved and enjoyed reading this book. And I have been a total book addict when young, I've read all greatest authors, all best classics. This book is great! I had not much thoughts about Harry and Meghan before the Netflix series and this, well I'm not British either so I didnt know much about the monarchy either ( apart how amazing Diana was, as all world knew that). This is a great book for me, a great story to tell. This is not just: the royal family are a bunch of insensitive, false, un-empathic etc etc stuff. This is a real story, about so much more. About how much twisted news are out there, how people can get rich by hurting other people, with no consequences. About how ugly the world is sometimes, and how important your direct family can be on how you embrace life. So many things resonate with our own story. Husband british, me the 'outsider'. I was told too of being rude and this and that. I never had a welcome into their family. His family had no clue what families are supposed to be. Cold blooded people, that don't feel love, dont feel anything. We moved town to be close to them, we never saw them. Poisonings my husband slowly, with awful comments until he decided to cut them off. Same as per Harry story, they claim they dont have any clue what they did wrong. For me there's royalty in this book, but there's a lot of what british society is as well. That negative politeness, of not wanting to give a toss for your own kind, your own brother, sister or whatever. Also loved Harry sense of humor, loved his honesty, loved all details and great description of places. Loved to hear about their love story."
Cindy,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend,"I liked this book. I felt like Harry was really trying to tell his own story for the first time. I also connected with his denial of his mother’s death- I had similar thoughts when my sister was murdered - perhaps something else happened and she was in hiding. So even though some of his problems were hard to relate to (relentlessness if press, getting cut off from funds and only having 30 million to fall back on), I related to his humanness and how hard he is trying. I wish him joy! A good read. I recommend for anyone who has experienced trauma or been to war."
libragirl1073,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m Sorry, Mate","I absolutely devoured this book. I am not a big fan of memoirs, as I find them fairly both boring and self serving; Spare, however, was a huge exception. I actually felt as I was within Harry’s mind as I read, and all I could think was, I can’t even imagine.I believe he has spoken the truth about his experience and I’m glad he felt empowered enough to do so.It is clear that Harry is like most of us; he wants a loving family, a devoted spouse, and freedom to make his own decisions about his life.I’m glad he finally has it."
Janelle Komorowski,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unexpected,"I don’t follow the tabloids, but one can’t be alive and not have heard the rumors about Harry, Megan, and the royal family. I wasn’t planning to read this book, but after hearing a scathing critique by Megyn Kelly, I wondered how she could possibly know the things she was stating as fact. So I read the book. It solidified my ideas about the monarchy, and changed my ideas on other things which I won’t share here so as not to spoil the book for future readers. I recommend this as an entertaining and informative read, but also one that will pull at your heartstrings."
t2stoner,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be who you say you are…,"…and speak your truth.  This was an easy and enjoyable read.Refreshingly honest account told by a real veteran of life, albeit royal life. Loved the book and appreciated the details of accounts of living this weird life.  Therapy should have been forefront in the royal family, but such is the English way.  The main conflux in the book being how the continued lies by both palace assistants and love of money, is hurting real people with no regard by the British press.  And like the viewers of Fox News, a certain type of readers/audience believe the lies."
Min,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I read this,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The last third of the book, I devoured.I'm glad Harry is happy and spoke his truth.It's not a trashy piece that trashes his family. Leave that to the British press.It's a heartfelt genuine story from the heart. Is Harry a Scholar? No and he doesn't pretend to be so parts are a bit whimsical and unnecessary.I still gave it 5 stars because it moved me so much. I guess because the main characters is someone we see in the press every single day so we feel we know him. But we don't.He's not cruel about his family. Just honest. It's not an attack I you are stating a hurtful fact.So much makes sense to me now.Even I could relate to parts. Not the fame and money. Haha.But the PTSD. Dysfunctional family, secrets and lies. Betrayal.But lots of love too.The royals are a normal family in an abnormal setting with stifling protocol and hangers on that feed off them like vultures. But Diana said the same.I don't understand why we have a monarchy to be honest. It represents hierarchy and divide and I think even Harry would admit its unfair on the people who pay towards them. And unfair on them in a way, as they are publicly disected.As Harry says, ""when is someone going to break free and live!""Go and live Harry and family.Thanks for explaining what really happens.I hope others get a life and leave yours alone."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is HIS life story.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It’s not a family bashing book, but he explains important times and situations in his life in a way that provides the reader with thoughtful insight. It’s clear he loves his family in Great Britain and wishes for their understanding instead of their complicit actions with the British press. He provides insight into how the RF works hand in hand with the tabloids so that their “wing” of the family is portrayed most favorably. Enjoyed his insight into his military life..most of which we had not heard. Well done."
Breb,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,the Spare,"I think a lot of people (royals included) were expecting Harry to drag his family through the mud.  Although they weren’t always presented in a favorable light it came across as disappointment in them not anger. I appreciated the simple approach. This was mostly about Harry, and then Harry and Meghan and their small family with interaction with his family thrown in. It’s interesting that the Monarchy has a need to present an image of personal perfection even at the risk of betraying another. Seems to me that with everything Harry has been through it’s amazing that he’s grown into such a wonderful man."
Pickles,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rooting for Harry’s Part Trois, a Prince in the USA","Prince Harry and the ghostwriter, Mr, Moeringher, have jointly done a fantastic job telling Harry Wales’ story - at least, thus far - with searing honesty.  Harry’s authentic voice comes through loud and clear - alternatingly funny, sarcastic, whimsical, nostalgic, tough and heart-rendingly sad.  What a man, a damaged, imperfect and still evolving man but one that at least this reader cannot help but respect . . . and root for.  There is much to be analyzed here about the dynamics - including the soul crushing aspects - of living as the “spare” in a monarchy - especially in these modern times. And much to be unpacked in this story about institutional racism, misogyny, modern masculinity and the uglier aspects of humanity - it’s greed and its schafenreude.  Harry, miraculously, seems to be an authentic fellow, trying his best to be a good person and lead a happy life.  At the end of the book, I found myself hoping for his success and to hear more about his future endeavors."
NikkyNikky,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"I took up his emotions at the beginning, I cried so sad after the death of their mother and laughed just reading the book and so many comedic moments. I love Prince Harry and his family. It’s sad that some secretaries in the family only believe in divide and conquer and can not see that no need to diminish a family member’s light for another family member to shine. Harry and Meghan have the X factor. Just like Diana, they are born that way.  The only person who is qualified to tell us about Meghan is Harry. He is a good judge of character.  He took his time to settle down. He is the one living with Meghan.  So the fake engineered tabloid. Just give up already we don’t believe you. Meghan is a lovely person and Prince Harry is awesome.  Let him and his family be."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This lad can write!,"Harry has received his calling — he is a gifted and brilliant writer. His mother would be proud. As a long-time Royal watcher, I had to buy the book and found it to be an unforgettable and fantastic read. The ""war"" scenes will be made into screen play(s)/movie(s) soon, I guarantee it and look forward to it. The ""unscholar"" of the Royal family turns out to be a deep and profuound thinker and writer. Also, reads like the wind. Couldn't put it down. I am impatiently awaiting the next great novel from this gifted man. Go for it, Harry!"
Cindi Miller,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wonderful read,"The book is written with emotion that can be felt. I got angry and cried with and for him, just wanting to hug him and yell that those hurting them to ""just stop!"" As an American ""royal watcher"" it disappoints me the lack of emotional support that he was given and that others in the royal family allowed this type of treatment to him, Meghan, and frankly, themselves. I wish Haz and Meg and their beautiful children find peace and solace in their life wherever they are. I recommend this book highly; best non-fiction I have read in a long time."
LadyMyth,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting and poignent,"This book really draws back the curtain on life as a British royal, and it was endlessly fascinating. I am so sad for what Harry and Meghan have gone through and still have to deal with, and most especially with how the royal family is complicit in it. Terrible. Best of luck to the two of them and the new, adorable family they have created. Great memoir. The only warning I have for readers is that if you're an animal lover as I am, just skip the sections about African poachers. There is a story in there that will ruin your entire week."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thoughtful, heartbreaking, hopeful","I didn't know if this memoir would be a soap opera. I'm happy to share it's not. All of the snippets that I heard before reading it that made it sound like Harry was just spilling family secrets for money, they were wrong. I appreciated the obvious thought and care that went into crafting his story and presenting it in such a way that you could fully see the trauma that he had to endure in his life both by his mother's death and by his unloving and unsupportive family, I was moved by the heartbreak he endured over and over because of the press and losing his mother and lack of privacy to just live his life, but what surprised me the most was seeing that he was able to navigate through all those dark times and get to another side or he's happy and fulfilled and lives with his wife who obviously adores him. I'm thrilled for him that he is able to do something to raise money both for his causes and to support his family. Should he have not shared certain details? Well I didn't need to know about his first time having sex ;) and there are a couple others but most of the information I read about, I understood why he wrote it. I wish him happiness and peace and hope that sharing his story now allows him to move past it and leave them behind and craft the new story of his life with his family."
Hmbass85,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was so excited for this book.,However I feel like some of the “most shocking” revelations were exposed by the media leading up to the release of the book and blown way out of proportion. When reading about them it seemed a lot of the strife between the two Princes (before Meghan) could be chalked up to run of the mill sibling squabbles. The book is broken into three parts and honestly the first two parts weren’t as exciting as I would have expected coming from a Prince writing a tell all. The third part though made up for that as it was mostly about the difficulty he and Meghan faced from not only the British media but also the Royal Family. All in all it was a good read as long as you go into it knowing that the hype around it is just that… hype.
Miacara,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much insight into a really good man,"I couldn't be more surprised at how deep, insightful and honest this book is. It's excellent. I have grown in respect for Harry and his commitment to telling the truth. I'm sad that so many people believe the tabloid lies and stories planted by ""the Firm"". This guy, Harry, is the real deal. The book is honest but not destructive and nothing like the way it's been depicted in the tabloids.  I am glad he put the truth on the table. I highly recommend it for insight into how things really work at the Palace, and what this articulate, honest, bright, integrous guy is all about."
Lucy,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Emotional- what a story!,"I don’t really read these types of books. I expected something totally different, but this book was so well written, so very emotional. I am so glad I read this book and I know I will read it many more times. I laughed, cried, was sad so many times, and at times it made me really look at myself. It brought out so many emotions in me. Mostly sadness, for Harry and Megan. I even felt sadness for his royal family.As one reviewer said, this is really a story about a boy growing into a man. I encourage everyone to read it."
l,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tragic, heart-breaking, necessary and a book Diana would be proud of","i am an american and had ZERO interest in anything having to do with the royal family (i don't think it should even be something that still exists in modern times), however, i have always been intrigued by Princess Diana and her untimely death and how out-spoken she was. she spoke the TRUTH when no one else would. she was mistreated, made a fool on the world stage, and because everyone (outside of the RF) could see she was an honest, beautiful soul, she was BELIEVED. harry is exactly like his mother. Diana left him and his brother $$ in case they ever had to escape the RF because Diana knew was a toxic, hateful, deranged place it was. she was able to protect her youngest son even in death and Harry makes that very clear. this is HIS story that he HAD to tell because his family couldn't be bothered to correct the press or defend him the same way they threw Diana to the wolves. i am SO happy to see that he finally has a voice and the truth is finally coming out. he is obviously an empath and a very kind soul and i hope this book gives him the peace that he desperately has been lacking. 5 stars!"
evam,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thoroughly believable, yet unbelievable!","I believe everything in this book and I cried at some points, because I couldn’t believe how poorly he was treated by his own family. Somehow I think when you’re born into this family, you’re just born into a business.You can feel his agony at wanting love from his father and his brother, and they just didn’t have the capacity to give it to him. For the it was just a business, and if you weren’t going to abide by the rules of the business, then you are wrong.I’ve always had the sense that William just didn’t look happy. I’m sure he loves his wife and children, but he never smiles, and when he manages to give a little bit of a grin, it just doesn’t quite make it there. However, Harry always had an impish grin, he always smiled, and when he met Megan that smile just magnified. While people might say that Megan ruined the family she didn’t ruin the family she saved Harry from the family.This is a great biography of Harry’s life so far. It is not the Harry and Megan story. She doesn’t come into the book until almost 70% into the story. This is truly his story, and after reading it, I can see why he left the Royal Family. They are horrible people who used Harry and then Harry and Megan to improve their own images.Great book!"
Award,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting Read,"Underlying tone of the book is loss and sadness. From Diana’s death to moments that a more mature Harry realizes he missed chances to get to know his great-grandmother or the other famous spare, Princess Margaret. Loss of his dad when he marries Camilla. Etc. First 2/3 of book is his education and war with some tidbits about his 2 meaningful lives Chels and Cress and his family. Last 1/3 is meeting and falling in love with MM. the wedding. The hopes and dreams. The fall out of the family. Definitely held back esp when it comes to William. Great read though very melancholy."
Meg,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and enjoyable read,"I have not put this book down. Although Harry is a very privileged man, the struggles of pain, loss, grief and love are all human struggles whether royal or not. If you have siblings, you know rivalry can get serious. This book takes you on all cycles of emotions, laughter, tears, sadness, sarcasm, fun, adventure, you name it. Am so glad the universe lined up and he found his true love!! Those two genuinely love each other!! I was left wanting those other 400 pages he left out. Highly recommend it!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Strength,"Harry's story of his life is one of strength and courage. The fact that he survives his mothers death and grew into a man that he is took strength, courage and amazing resiliency. How he survived his family that think more of their popularity and titles than their family is an amazing accomplishment. I just hope that future readers of this book can read it with an open heart and mind, and not with skewed perception of what they have read in the trash the British call press. If they can do that they hear the truth and understanding why Harry is where he is today and why that was necessary."
Sasha,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well done Harry!,I have always been interested in the Royals and now through Harry’s life story I see.how the Royals goes through life in not seeing what their family members are feeling. William is like his father and Harry is like his mother. That why when Harry made the decision to leave his family King Charles and Prince William didn’t understand why he was leaving.  If they read his book I do not think they will still understand Harry’s reason.  If you do not have the book please get it.  You will be happy you did.  Well done Harry!
Laura,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful,It has amazed me since the beginning of this story that people..those in the U.K. mostly… are more than willing to attack the abused instead of holding the abusers accountable. It’s a sad story because I do believe Harry’s father and brother care for him in their own way. That said I absolutely believe each household bartered Harry and mostly Meghan in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. We saw this when both Diana’s and Charles households sold out the other in attempts to get sympathy from the public. This time around Harry was the lamb offered up.As someone who lost a loved one..what Harry says about thinking Diana was coming back is absolutely true and makes the case of allowing even children to see the loved ones dead body…to find closure. For years and years I thought my brother would “come home.”Such a heartbreaking story. I wish Harry all the happiness with his own family. I hope for reconciliation for them all.
Emma Hall,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,No one should be a Spare,I have enjoyed this read and it has shown how much is wrong not only with British Press but press world wide. I am not 100% convinced at parts of the book which is why it was not a 5. Sadly in my lifetime I don't believe we will get to hear the institutions side of events - maybe that is telling.Any child to lose a mother the way they both did is sad and cruel. Any man who want's to stop history repeating itself is a man of the hour. Agree with him or not he has a wife and two children to protect.I am glad I was not born into this world.

From the very beginning where he talks about his mother all the way to end. More so than even the stories, the vocabulary and literary nature of this book stands out against most other nonfiction work. Not a single page felt meh or boring, all of it had captured my attentions. Kudos to Prince Harry for sharing his story in his words, standing up for his family against racist douchebags."

The Sussexes get a lot of hate (and so much of this book was taken out of context + dissected unfairly) but I found Harry’s book to be eloquently written + powerfully reflective. Sure, there were a few parts that seemed a bit “cringey” but it’s his book, he surely put a lot of thought into what anecdotes to include. Those few moments added a bit of humanity to his story in my opinion. I imagine it must feel so liberating to him that he finally has his side of the story out there."

He was born into this family, wasn't his choice.He did everything in his power to follow the rules and protect his family.Everyone turned a blind eye...he had no other choice to keep his family safe.

I never thought I'd say that, but I sincerely wish for Britain to abolish the monarchy, even if just to set that poor family free. I also hope that William will never be king, he sounds seriously unhinged."

And that people form opinions about that person based on how they came to hear it. Sadly, only through tabloids.Considering that most people until recently only knew Harry from what was in the media. All he is trying to do is tell his story,  himself."
Whitney,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,feel bad for him!,"Thought this was a decent memoir. Pretty sad, I feel bad for him. After the entire book, I still find myself struggling to empathize with him. I prefer when there is more of a motif or essential life lesson distilled throughout a memoir. The motif here seemed to be helplessness, unresolved trauma, but I didn’t really empathize because so much of it is just railing against press coverage and palace PR practices. I get it. Can see how the fish bowl magnified the distress as well. Yet… I don’t think the story line or narrative really drew a strong enough line to make that motif relatable to a reader who isn’t in the royal family, and I feel like that was a missed opportunity!"
Diamond Donna,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book!,This book was an eye opener as to what goes on behind the scenes in palace life. I read this book in 2 days because I couldn’t put it down. It is very honest and revealing. I will never look at the monarchy the same and my sympathies are without any doubt with Harry and Meghan. Meg is in many ways likePrincess Diana and I’m sooooo glad they left the monarchy. Definitely worth reading it is a great read and I highly recommend reading this well written account of Harry’s life to date.
Rachel Crist,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected….but in a GOOD way.,The last 1/4 of the book was what I thought moat of the book would be about. Harry and Meg. But to my surprise the majority of Harry’s life laid bare with every painful thought and memory of a anxious troubled life. My own thoughts and frustration whirled around the constant revelations of press presence. It’s bad when all you wish is to be deployed in order to have a sense of freedom.I highly suggest this read. The premise is something that needs to be acknowledged and addressed.

I am a writer and can appreciate when a story flows so seamlessly. I relate to Harry's experience with his father and older brother treating him so dismissively. And Meghan, you are nothing but a champion. I'm so glad you found each other. You are both incredibly courageous - remember that it takes courage to live at the level of honesty - you both have it! Ignore those who like to hate just for the sake of hatred. You are supported and loved by the vast majority!"
Mary,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,it’s a very well written book,"Whoever wrote it knew what they were doing! Well done. I specially liked Harry’s reminiscences about his childhood, time in Ladgrove and Eton, about his time in the army. I believe it’s very honest up to that point. When it comes to Meghan it’s comes a little bit less natural. Although, of course, without any doubts he loves her, it read a bit strange.  I think this part lacking sincerity and vivacity ( like the beginning of this book).  But very very interesting for us, common people.  Some phrases will become quotations, I am sure!"

Isn’t that what we all want? Why doesn’t he deserve it? Why can’t he protect his family and seek peace? I’m so happy for his life now and seeing interviews he’s doing on his press tour - he seems like a totally different person. His mom would be so proud. Great read. Gives you more context to all of the stories and snippets out there.
Terry L. Rollins,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Effort… You Might Be Surprised,"If all you do is listen to the naysayers about how Harry has betrayed his family his King and his country and you chose not to read this book, then you are proving his point… that the media controls the narrative.  Harry lays it all on the line.  Is it one sided?  Of course… that’s what memoirs are… the recollections of the person telling the tale.  I read the book and I’m glad I did because it’s honest, insightful and well written.  Is everything he said the exact way it really happened?  Maybe not but at least he made the effort to put himself out there… to make his side of the story known.  I have more respect for Harry after hearing about the brutal training he went through for the Army and the intense focus and smarts he needed to be an Apache helicopter pilot since people are always quick to say he’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  I wanted my own take on what Harry had to say so I read it and I’m glad I did.  Read it yourself then decide what you think… you may be surprised."
Natalie ,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Healing Journey,"Despite all the media vitriol attacking Prince Harry, reading this book was a compelling and heart-opening experience. It is obvious that not only does he deeply love Meghan, but his father and brother very much as well, despite everyones' imperfections. The tribute he paid to Princess Diana was evocative and beautiful. I truly hope his whole family can all rise above the divisiveness that various obstacle makers are making for them -- bad actor motives being media headlines, clickbait, praise by contrast, selfishness, and immaturity. I wish this family having genuine happiness together."
Susan O'Rourke,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written, authentic, tragic","I could not put this book down. It was entertaining, sad, happy, emotional, horrifying all at the same time. I am not surprised by the antics of the press and their minders/keepers - sadly it goes on here too in the US. As a Brit much of what was included I had heard/seen before and the book helped me to make better sense of what had been written. I am so glad Prince Harry was able/enabled to open himself up to learning, growing, increasing awareness and being fully in touch with his feelings. Bravo!"
Sandra Hurd,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Read,"Wow. Very touching and nice to read the truths behind some of the dumbest headlines that reached America. So sad in many ways, but unveiling the real relationships - siblings, press, citizens. Being royalty seems so much less inviting and I feel for all of them; as it seems the press drove so many of the issues in that family.  Fame and fortune or not; depression, anxiety, trauma - those are the same physically painful afflictions for all of us.  Hopefully H’s new country can help him breathe easier and enjoy life with his beautiful family."
Samantha,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,loved it!,"Memoirs/biographies are not my usual genre so I wasn’t sure how much I’d like this, but I’ve always been a fan of England, it’s history and the royals. I absolutely loved ‘Spare’. I read it and listened to the audiobook (recommend!). Beautifully told… and I really feel for Harry. I hope he and Meg have a long happy life together, he deserves it.*edit to add*I didn’t think the book/Harry seemed unhinged or vindictive, as the media and tik tokkers make it out to be. It’s a heartfelt story, and Harry’s truth."
Chrisotpher Troy Bowen,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,straight from the horses mouth,"I thought it was incredibly brave and raw to put all that out. Dealing with his childhood trauma and apparently every day little more trauma. Like death by a thousand paper cuts. Eventually you break. He has a family now to protect which we all know why.  The Monarch is very wrong here. Also, William needs an attitude adjustment, as my grandparents would say.  If Britain doesn’t want him fine- the U.S. will take him and love him. Thank you Harry- for a great read and an insight in to your journey. Best Wishes- Jennifer Bowen"
サラ,Reviewed in Japan on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,単なる王室暴露本では無い。,本書のメインテーマは王室の内情を暴露することでも、(確かに批判的な記述はありますが)王室を批判することではなく、12歳の少年であった筆者が母親を失い、その死にどう向き合ってきたのか、またメディアによる過剰報道・乱暴とも言える取材方法が20年以上に亘り彼の日々の生活、そして人生そのものにどのように影響を与えたのかということが本書の最も大きいテーマだと思いました。正直、筆者の生活について記載が細かすぎると思う部分もありましたが、母親を亡くした12歳以降の筆者の人生について詳細に情報を記述することでタブロイド誌や自称王室専門家による憶測やデタラメ記事の内容や表象を否定したいという思い、そして、そのようなメディアへの怒りが文章からも滲み出ていました。既に本書の内容について面白おかしく報道しているゴシップ誌やメディアが多数あり、私自身面白がってそのような記事を読み、本書を読むに至りましたが、実際に本書を読んでみて、、私が確認した限り本書の本質的な内容を紹介する報道はほとんど無かった印象です。尚、筆者自身の人生に焦点を当てた内容なのでネットフリックスのドキュメンタリーの切り口とも少し違います。メインテーマ以外にも、王室で育ったという特殊性はありますが、従軍経験談など2000年以降の欧米圏の一若者としての日記というか自叙伝としても面白い本でしたし、(王室離脱等について彼らの対応が全て正しかったのかは未だに分かりませんが)筆者と妻への見方も少し変わりました。私は彼らの戦略に乗せられているだけかもしれませんが、、メディアの報道内容について、読み手も少しクリティカルに読まないと行けないなと反省しましたし、幼少期から乱暴な取材に振り回されている筆者に対しては同情する感情が増しました。正直想定外に興味深い本でした。ヘンリー王子・王室ネタの関心有無に拘らず、おすすめしたい本です。
Naomi,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful, Emotional, Gut wrenching","What a beautiful display of sadness and regret! I was glad I read this book to discover the lies the media had displayed about this strong family and now I know the truth. I believe you, Harry! So glad you found your way out of the horror of your existence over there. Of course, you displayed great courage in your writing this memoir. So hoping someday you write a sequel. May you find your way in this not so kind world remembering God is real and He loves you. Great read. Beautifully written!"
BookDyva,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,“…To thine own self be true…”,"I can only imagine how I’d handle the pain and struggle Prince Harry has endured since his mother’s death. Opening up to the world, pulling back the curtain on his life, mental health and the Monarchy to reveal the not so pretty parts takes courage.For his love of Shakespeare, King Charles III would make an awesome Polonius. It’s a sad state of affairs when your family turns on you; all in the name of loyalty to an ancient hierarchical institution. With a family like this who needs enemies?! Some may say he’s, “airing the family’s dirty laundry!”; I say he’s speaking truth to power!!"
Michael R.,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is important, but the British press have told you not to read it.","This is a great book.  Harry tells an important story, of a life made unliveable by the British press. I was touched by his genuine affection for William and Charles.  It is well written, I couldn’t put it down, and very thought-provoking about the obscene power of the British press.However, the British press cannot have you read this book, so they have told you not to and they have gone ‘all out’ on pressing all available buttons to persuade you from reading it!  Run along now, children, nothing to see here!"
GG,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t criticize him until you have read his side of the story,"I’m shocked at how many people have listened to lies and been critical of Harry without hearing his side and at least considering his explanations. He admits his poor judgment and mistakes but also shows you how damaged he has been from the loss of his mother and the lack of support from his family against all the lies of the press. This book is well written, interesting and I could hardly put it down. As a man I would want to protect my wife and kids just as he has. Horrah for Harry."
KatheinCali,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Open, Honest, Inspiring &Heartbreaking. Finally A Truth Is Told","This is a great book to read for those who want to be inspired to tell their truth. Its time that people start talking, and try to heal. I see this has a olive branch to his family, who are so busy trying to hide who they really are, that they will sell other family members down the river before letting the world see their true selves. Its a shame, and it is a large part of what is destroying humanity. I congratulate Harry on his courage to talk, bravery in protecting his wife and children, while trying to remain a good human. His back was up against the wall by the royal, and I dont see where he had any choice but the one he has made. People who criticize he and Meghan, need to do some introspection and try to put on his shoes and see how they would respond. Probably not as honorable or with such reserve. I can tell he didnt tell everything in order to keep protecting his 'Royal' family. He said enough to try to help people to understand the truth and make a living, and purge the pain and suffering that they caused him. He is doing what is right. He is fighting back, fairly."
Lisa Bee,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartfelt story, Beautifully told","I don’t know how anyone could not feel for Prince Harry after reading this book. The prose just tugs at your heartstrings and his experiences seem so real and relatable, which is interesting to consider since he’s literally a prince who grew up in palaces. But every single one of us have faced grief, or strained family relations, or mental health issues, or the struggle to find your purpose in life. And in that sense, his journey reflects what so many people experience. So I highly recommend this book!"
Marchangel,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating,"For anyone interested in the Royal family and how they operate as a business it’s a fascinating read into the cut throat lives of the royals.  From an insider that knows, you get a glimpse of how the royal family works with the British tabloid press to maintain their cherished reputation which in turn earns them money and maintains their charity gigs.  A heart wrenching look at a Prince trying to break out of the dysfunctional system he was raised in whilst also trying to preserve familial relationships within the family business.  Highly recommend."
Trinity S Thomas,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such Courage and Love,"A glimpse into making sense of an unusual, often misrepresented, yet loving and authentic life. Courage of many sorts is the unifying weave. Harry does not seem to gloss over his immature actions, emotional reactions, and even errors in judgement. He tells his truth. It is liberating. His rivalry with his brother, complicated relationship with his father, life as a soldier, beautiful love story with his wife, are all laced with his unique worldview and struggle to find his place. Gorgeously written. I am so sad that I reached the end; I want more."

After this, I will never look at a headline again and see any truth, they are full of crap.  Wishing him, his wife and kiddos a very happy life free at last!!"
SL Hoops,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,An eye-opening wonder,"Ignore the headlines and make up your own mind. This is a book I couldn’t put down. It’s startling to join the strange lives these people lead and see how everything is truly a facade. I had suspicions that Meg was the black swan of the group, but no, she’s just a normal person and it is they who are the black swans. I am only giving it four stars because there are certain parts that made no sense, like when he jumps in the ocean in what he described as giant waves that threatened to drown him. Also, while impressive, I skipped over some of the military passages. I highly recommend this book. Well done. Harry."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written, poignant, loved it","I actually loved reading this book. It made me laugh and it made me cry and I now know Gran Gran (Queen Mother) loved a gin martini, yet I felt sad that Harry never cried when his mother died until a girlfriend years later asked him about it. I love his African experiences…North and South Pole adventures and his detailed narrative about meeting and falling in love with Megan . Loved it!  And I was one who actually started to turn against him; I now can see why he did what he did! Great book! Well written!"
Kristin Prusynski,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written. If you enjoyed Andre Agassi's ""Open"", you'll love Spare.","As I started reading ""Spare"", I was immediately struck by the quality of the writing. It turns out that Harry's ghostwriter, JR Moehringer, is the same guy that wrote Andre Agassi's stunning autobiography, Open.Much like ""Open"", I definitely felt like Harry revealed himself with stunning honesty. In ""Open"", I felt like Agassi was on the other side of all of his trauma, but Harry is still in it. That's maybe the hardest thing about this book is that you feel as if Harry is fighting a noble, but maybe unwinnable, fight. He's going to be writing another book in 10 years, and I just hope that he's okay by then."
Toni Lawson,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perception is Reality,"No matter what you have read or glanced in the press, this is his TRUTH!!!I have always been interested and drawn to his Mummy and then him. My favorite picture of them both is an embrace between them when he was young. My heart always hurt for him at the loss of his Mummy. She would be proud of you and the LIFE you have built for your family. This clears up so much. I only hope that more will read this and see HIM."
Robin Greer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry lets his walls down,"I actually think writing this book was brilliant. He is using something that has caused him so much pain and grief to become a multi millionaire. The media continues to put their spin on it but if you read his book, you will see him quite differently than how he is portrayed by the media. He is accomplishing something his mother could not and honors her and his wife by doing so. Don't trust the media's version!! A real, behind the scenes love story of a family is what I got from it."
DaisyHead J,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful,"Honestly, had no idea what to think about any of this. Quite happy I took the leap and the time to read it straight from the source. Much of what I absorbed from the media was indeed negative. It was only after seeing his interview on Colbert.. and then watching the Netflix series that lead me to spend the weekend appreciating a much different story. An easy and pleasant read.. highly recommend, enjoyed it very much! A very fascinating man.. can’t believe it was William I crushed on all those years.. silly me 🤣"
Kat,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really enjoying this book,"This book is very well written. No matter what your opinion on the discord in the Royal family, it is a depiction of Harry's life. I loved all the detail about his experiences. I can empathize with him and understand his journey as I lost my husband in my 30's to cancer. So I know his struggle with grief. The book gives people a greater understanding of the grief journey and what is is like grow up in a family of privilegewith those who show little emotion.  I always loved Diana and had so much respect for the Queen.  This gives me more of the picture. Very well done."
Jayme M.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I read this book.,"I admit it, I'm obsessed with the Royal Family, and wow has there been a lot of fanfare about this book! I watched all the interviews, read all the stories about the leaks before the book even came out but I'm so glad I read the book to see the full context of everything Harry had to say. I see this as a human story, of a man trying to find his own way, to be free of the crutch in the institution that he was raised in. With all the negative stories written about him and his wife, I'm so glad for him that this memoir sets the record straight and reveals his side."
Kristin,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't see any reason for the Royal to have their noses out of joint.,Prince Harry does a great job telling about his life.

I don't understand the way William and now King Charles have abandoned Harry .  God  Bless Harry and his small family and may God bless the new King and give him wisdom and love for his second son who he has abandoned from birth with the love he was due
Lanie,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved this book as much as I’m appalled by the way they were treated,"I knew a lot of what had happened because I’d seen some of the interviews.  The book filled in a lot of the gaps.  It’s written in a way that you feel then pain and are left wondering, where is the shame?  From the British press.  From the Royal Family?  It’s hard to imagine the cruelty.  I’m happy to have them here with us now where they’re appreciated and hopefully left in safety and privacy to enjoy their lives.  I highly recommend reading."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Prince's Journey to Find Peace, Purpose & Love!",The story is not what I expected after all the press snippets. Harry is thoughtful and introspective. A person on a journey to heal from childhood traumas and be a better person. His love for his very imperfect family shines through and is something most people can relate to. A fascinating look at the palace intrigue and the unhealthy royal connection with the British press. His clear love of the military where he found purpose and importantly fueled his ongoing desire to be of service. I loved this book.
Amanda Thornton,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So well written! The honesty and emotion pour through,"I am ongoing and continually shocked at the absolute hatred, vitriol, lies and betrayal from the British press towards Harry and Megan. I suppose I should not be shocked, since they were the ones who murdered Diana.  I absolutely cannot understand why that country has allowed the royal family to be tortured by such vultures. And not just Harry, but the whole family !!!This book gives such an honest overview of what he went through. He’s an amazing human being, and he’s been in a situation that you were born to that no one would’ve ever wanted. He’s handled it all with grace and done the absolute best he could.  He’s protected his wife and children by doing things he thought would ultimately keep his family safe. In the meantime the press continually tries to tell all sorts of lies. In the end, history will know the truth. Because Harry wrote it in very plain English in this wonderful book!! Bravo! Harry is so brave, and so much like his mother. Well done! A wonderful and riveting read!"

In 1998, my husband and I visited Paris, and we went to the tunnel. My heart is with this family. I hope Meg and Harry and their children can LIVE their lives. I hope the family members who are still here will reconcile. Above all, I hope the press leaves them alone and focuses on the good."
K. Grawe,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A compelling read.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Harry’s book.  All the negative reviews are about Harry’s supposed whining given his privilege.  He was in a gilded cage, no support, dealing with all the lies from the British press while his own family stayed silent - doesn’t this give him every right to stand up, speak his truth and say enough?!  Kudos to Harry for leaving the constrictions of palace life and living his life on his own terms.  I’d give his book 10 stars if I could."

Deb McGinnis,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very introspective,"Not what I expected. It’s basically the story of a boy who survives the loss of his mother and living in an archaic system where the royals are not allowed to have flaws. At the very least they cannot show them. Rules abound and it’s like an evil chess game between the tabloids and the Brits. They adore their royals but seem to enjoy dirt more. I am glad he got himself and his family out. More over, a story of survival, not revenge."
LG,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great read!,"Very well written! I was surprised how descriptive open & honest it is. You feel like you're there as Harry recounts experiences from his youth, his two tours of duty in the army, travels to Africa & his relationship with his wife. It is very moving, at times sad, funny, and inspiring. I recommend also getting the audiobook to listen as you read along. Harry is a great narrator & his humor really comes across when u hear him speaking the words."
Poppy Seed Child,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for you Harry and Meghan,"Harry does an excellent job laying everything out.  We get an insight into Harry as a person.  The real person and not the persona spoonfed to us literally since the day he was born.  I feel for him, but am glad for him too.  It is not easy to stand up to such a toxic family.  I did and mine was NOT the royal family.  He and Meghan are strong, deserve to be happy, and I wish them the best future they can have."

I’m only on page 35 it’s a thick book, so far he writes about the scenario around his mothers death.

JJenkins,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry Is Very Believeable,"I  found Harry's story very believable. It also is very well written. I realize there was a collaborator/writter, but Harry comes off as much more bright and articulate than previously portrayed.  I've read a few books on the British Royal Family, both pro and con. So, I'm aware of the embelished or fictitious stories that Harry references in the book. It's sad that the press (and the palace) has nothing better to do than to make up garbage. I don't think Meghan is perfect but I do think Harry is honest.The smartest person in the family has been Princess Anne--who didn't allow her children to have titles. She understood the burden of it all! This catch 22 where you're not given an education or support that allows you to have a profession, and then your father (a multi-millionaire) tells you there's not enough money for him to support you and your family--even when you're donating your family's time to ""the firm"" and their projects?  It really is pretty screwed up!"
Karen Houser,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Poignant Read!,"In reading reviews from the UK, I can see that the UK tabloids have done their job well. They have created this whirlwind of hate for Harry and Meghan and keep perpetuating it with lies upon lies. Imagine how differently things could have turned out if there had been some admiration and kindness shown to this couple. It’s so sad that the only way Harry could finally have his voice heard is by writing his own book. I wish Harry and Meghan and their precious little family peace and happiness."

It was so eye opening to read of the immense grief at the loss of his mother. I hold great disdain for the press and the media. Yet, it was still shocking to read of the low levels they resort to.

Reviewer,Reviewed in Germany on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A book that gives courage.,"I read the book to make up my own mind after the very concerted and well orchestrated attempt of the media and, I assume, the Royal family to discredit it. It is not at all as described by them. It is a story of a young man overcoming trauma, finding his own strength and his person. Prince Harry’s account is very honest and raw, not at all self-pitying or whingy and not above admitting his own mistakes.  I find his story  encourages people to stand up for themselves, seek help when needed and follow their own path unflinchingly, independently of toxic family dynamics or machinations of a dysfunctional and archaic institutions. Highly recommend reading it."
C  Howard,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Raw Honest Autobiography—The Good, The Bad and Everything in Between","Every once in awhile, a well known celebrity shares their personal story, but rarely with such depth, openness and brutal honesty. Not since “The Ragman’s Son” by Kirk Douglas have I gained such insight from an autobiography. The press read “Spare” for the bombshells, but the book itself is very evenhanded and portrays the ups and downs of a dysfunctional family living their lives in the public eye. I can only wish Prince Harry, Meghan and their children well as they continue their lives of impactful global service to others. There is no one more blind than those who refuse to see or less informed than those who do not listen."
Liz,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Read,"I had expected it to be a good read, even with all the leaks that have come out. But this book struck such a vulnerable spot in my heart. It made me see the things in my family that were there also all a long. Helped me understand the points in my relationships (parents, siblings, marriage, and children). There are very personal, intimate parts to the book that explains in detail why they made the decisions they did. In the end, I am happy for their journey."
what.it.is,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent. Raw, refreshing, setting the record straight.","I was Diana’s age, and I was obsessed with her. I’ve followed her children and the rest of the royal drama since. I am absolutely thrilled that Harry has had a chance to finally set the record straight and that the book is flying off the shelves. Almost makes all the pain the British media has caused worth it. I hope it goes into multiple printings and stays at the top of the best seller lists. I couldn’t put it down; I binged it in a day."
Allen Gerner,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haz and Meghan are the bravest people alive,"They went through hell, thick and thin. I have one thing that they wish they did, anonymity.  No one knows who I am, and no one cares. In the face of such a terrible racist press, my anonymity is such a security blanket. I wish that M&H (Meghan and Harry) find the peace that they deserve. Free from the paparazzi. But through all of the pure hell that both of them went through, their love of each other helped them endure."
N M,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasted potential for a great read,"Read this because I want to give everything a fair hearing.First up - the British media in the week before this was released printed things that are absolutely not correct. This is because the Spanish version was leaked first, and bad mistranslations occurred, with screeching headlines about words like ""mounted"", that are absolutely not included in the original English version. Several anecdotes in this memoir have been misrepresented due to this. Lies half way around the world before the truth has time to put its boots on etc.The first half of this book is genuinely interesting and at times funny, with vivid and evocative (credits to the ghost writer) depictions of school life, Botswana, Afghanistan and training with the British Army in a variety of damp English moors. The chapter style is short, punchy, and rolls nicely with the flow of these early tales, and some of the descriptive writing really is beautiful (again, credits to JR Moehringer). He seems interesting, and interested in life, learning and changing with the omnipresent grief over the very public loss of his mother. He grapples with what many do as teenagers and young adults - who am I, what do I want to be, can I be a good person, what does that look like?However, then there is a tone shift in the writing just over half way through, around 2015/2016. From then on, this book is straight up dull. The meeting Meghan story seems inconsistent with how they originally said they met, and is only reflective of the version that was recently included in Netflix. From here on out, his memoir is littered with saccharine cliches about love that must only be interesting to those who have never been in love, like young teenagers. Because reading it as an adult provokes a little second hand embarrassment - like yeah, we get it, she's totally the one and there's a spiritual connection, she's the most beautiful ever etc. It's great he thinks and feels that way, but for the rest of the world who isn't in an erotic relationship with Meghan Markle, it's really repetitive and boring.The disjointed nature of the chapters starts to not work around this stage too, partly because the writing starts to get quite overdramatic. There's at least 3 accounts of Meghan ""sobbing on the floor"".Sentences are written in new lines constantly.For dramatic..Emphasis.But much of what he is describing is incredibly pedantic - fights over tiaras (have it ready at this time...no I'm busy then... well what about this time... no I'm not free then either... okay...), dresses for children for the wedding (it doesn't fit, so my kids crying... get it altered... no need a new dress... get it altered... okay... *sobbing on the floor*).In my opinion it is absolutely true that Meghan Markle was treated vilely by the British press and that there were racial undertones - ""straight outta Compton"", ""exotic DNA"", ""gangsta royal"" and of course the photo of a chimp leaving the hospital - however if this book was supposed to make Harry and Meghan seem likeable, unfortunately they don't come across that well either. Both are wrapped up in a dramatic fervour around press, not seeming to realise that the more they retaliated, the worse it got. I can't understand it, having never been in the situation myself, but I think it's safe to say their media strategy didn't go to plan, as they rank as deeply unpopular figures around the globe.Use of language such as ""fleeing for our lives from my Mother country"" is not only hyperbolic, it comes across as downright offensive. When so much of the world's population flees war, political insecurity, persecution due to religion or sexual orientation, when refugees travel barefoot and on sinking dinghies to escape areas - further destabilised by the British Army, I might add - because without this dangerous journey, they face execution, ""fleeing for our lives"" meaning getting a first class flight and the biggest strife being setting up a camera to record your thoughts in the departure lounge seems at best disingenuous and at worst totally F****** clueless and self absorbed.It is a shame that the first half of this book wasn't the entire book, with more detail. Prince Philip, despite being a pretty fascinating character, is mentioned in passing maybe 4 times, Princess Anne once, his uncle Edward not at all, Princess Eugenie once, Beatrice not at all. There was so much more potential for this book, for discussions about Spare v Heir that maybe talked about the same feelings from his fathers siblings - how do they feel as ""Spares""? Who knows because it's not included. He constantly talks about the fear for his wife and his life due to the press whipping up nastiness, but doesn't discuss the actual armed kidnapping attempt (with several men shot) of Princess Anne? The time the Queen was shot at 6 times? The post Meghan chapters also seem extremely rushed. There are huge chunks of information and events missing that he just never mentions, which is odd. He doesn't discuss his own feelings around his wife being pregnant, around Prince Philip dying, around the Australian tour, around his grandparents and family meeting his children, what kind of parent he'd like to be. I also feel he overplayed his hand in sharing so much in podcasts, the Oprah interview, Netflix, because I could recite the post 2016 narrative he tells in my sleep now.Lots of potential, but ultimately squandered for cliches and navel gazing."
Karen Hayes,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you!,"Thank you for sharing your story, Prince Harry.  Opening up the proverbial ""can of worms"" and laying out your thoughts and emotions while detailing a complicated row you've hoe'd your entire life cannot be easy.  The read was an emotional rollercoaster and for someone who has recently lost her mother, I can relate on some level but cannot begin to fathom the devastation of losing your family through the fanatical antics of the media.Bravo, to you and your lovely wife.  Bravo!"
Tani Lee Schneider,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and Honest,"This book is filled with love and heartache and grief and such honesty! I loved this book! I’m not surprised about a lot of the things revealed in this book, more than that, I’m truly sorry to find my suspicions validated.  Prince Harry told his truth and I know it was difficult to do. I was moved to tears reading this book. The journey of healing is a long one and sometimes it takes a lifetime. It’s very well written. I highly recommend this book."
Lynn Wilkinson,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bravo Prince Harry,","I don’t want to hear anyone say, “He shouldn’t have written it.” unless they have read it. A truly compelling account of a life filled with emotions to deep to be expressed and too unacceptable to those who should have cared for him. A must read for every abandoned child, anyone from a broken home and anyone who, lost a parent at a young age. A great book for those enamored by the monarchy. i hope it makes it to the top of the best sellers list,"
T. B.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry Spare Book Review,Just finished.I wanted to read this book instead of relying on the media reports. Every line requires context.The ghostwriter's writing and Harry's content made for a riveting narrative. Almost reads like a novel.Fills in gaps from the Oprah Whinfrey interview and the Netflix series.Harry is basically telling his side for the record.One would think that the late Queen Elizabeth and now King Charles with all their power and prestige could have prevented all this acrimony.
Elizabeth Hawk,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Humanizing,"I found the story of Harry’s life troubling. The lack of support from the Royal family appalling.  While I’ve always found the Royal Family fascinating, I also believed they were each others staunchest supporters. I cannot fathom being hunted like dogs and being treated as sub human as Harry has had to endure his whole life. It’s praiseworthy that Harry has taken this step to have truth known to those who care to understand. I wish both Harry and Meghan a lifetime of peace, happiness and lasting love."
Gingerdwarf,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Truth or fiction,"I fluctuated regarding acquiring this book. I’m glad I did as from the beginning of the book it was obvious neither boys had properly addressed their mothers sad death and if to be believed of Will’s anger he still had not come to terms with the awful way she died. I firmly believe it was the chasing paps with their blinding flashlight cameras was the cause of the crash and not the driver under the influence, sadly never proven but covered up!Harry’s continued conviction that he was the ‘spare’ spoke of family neglect in that nobody explained how the royal family worked and still steeped in old fashioned traditions of upbringing, Charles himself being a perfect example.I’m sure a lot of un-retractable and irreversible harm has befallen Harry and Megan’s relationship with his father and brother and there are some passages where you could believe what happened. However it’s wrong of them both to air their views in public no matter how hard done by they feel. Far better to show a united front to face the world and show that they can rise above the incorrect reporting etc., which means far more than constant whinging which is the way both press and public will see it.I’ve struggled to believe wholly that Harry was always ignored and just a ‘spare’. Unfortunately this is the way of royalty, Charles himself hanging on, Anne, Andrew and Edward all struggling to find their niche within the family  making their mistakes along the way but not rising to the bait of the gutter press!I hope sincerely this can all fade away stop trying to prove who you are and stand for and continue with your good charity work. I do feel for Megan in that she entered a world totally alien to her where ‘friendship’ and closeness is never allowed to be shown. She should have been fully conversant of all the facts and yes sometimes bizarre traditions. I thank god I never had to curtesy to my grandma or father!Let this now be the end of sniping etc., and settle into your new life accepting it won’t be within the royal entourage. You have a lovely family, a wife who adores you. Take stock and move on."
Janet E,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this book…,"Thanks to Harry for his insightful book about what we all don’t know ( but have wondered) about how it is to be royal. The good the bad the ugly. Harry is just like us. He’s a normal, loving, giving, insightful husband, father and son who happened to be born into an archaic monarchy. You can’t help but love him. He’s living his true self now. He is loved, adored and has found HIS home in the arms of his wife, children and many friends. Enjoy."
Gail Wallig,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Page turner; insightful; sad with hope,"Hope M&H (and their children) find the peace, love, kindness and support they so deserve.

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Excellent book. I'm so glad that it was written. The British Press should be ashamed of how they treat the royal family members. It shows that greed is what controls all the news and media. They do not care who's life they destroy, as long as they get paid for writing lies, they will insight riots, and destroy the world in the process.Meg and Harry deserve to live their lives and raise their family with love and kindness away from the anxiety and tension that Harryhad to endure."
angela houston,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this book!,"Having been a huge fan of Princess Diana’s over the years, I had to get this book as soon as it was released. I’m sorry she wasn’t here to protect him from the institution. I truly admire him for fleeing from their grasp and protecting his little family. His Mummy is so proud of her boy! Thank YOU for telling us your truth!  You deserve freedom and happiness, just like your Mummy wanted for you and her!"
Liz,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful. Moving. Don’t believe the media BS,"This was great. You could feel it was written from the heart. I teared up at many moments when he spoke about his mom. I also feel it was respectfully written and proves you shouldn’t believe everything you read. He spoke of his father, the king movingly over and over. It was clear he has a great love for him. He is hurt. It was not a “tell all” or garbage the media would have you believe. Give it a try. Definitely worth it."
Happy Camper CC,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unlocking of the Boy who fought for his life and family.,"The book is extremely frank and provides a wealth of information regarding the challenges that Prince Harry overcame both in his youth and as an adult. If Diana could see him now, the man, husband, and father that he is, she would be incredibly proud of him. I am grateful to Harry for allowing us to learn about his suffering, struggles, and the truth. Harry, you should be proud of yourself! Best wishes to you, Meg, Archie, and Lili.

khttk98,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt,"I’ve always loved Diana and her “boys”. Harry bares his soul in this book. Grief unites all of us. For all of the pomp and circumstance of royalty, he was still a 12 year old boy who tragically lost his mom. His description of his feelings and how he copes throughout the years resonates with anyone who grieves a loved one. He very accurately describes his time serving his country. He speaks to the rage he felt at lies about him in the press. He speaks to the urge to fight back that overwhelmed him. Well done Harry!!"
MariT,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,True Story,The book is amazing. It is his heart poured out. The detail of his feeling and mental health written in the most delicate way. It gives us a sense of normality as to what a family goes through no matter the social levels. It’s pain showed as words to feel a release and freedom from negativity. This is a step of Celebrate Recovery and he is now free! To all the readers don’t judge just learn from his experience to just become better people.
Kerry P Wright,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Royal Family is uptight!!!,"All this time I thought Harry and Meaghan were whiners.Seems they have a right to be…..the royal family is completely dysfunctional.I know all families have issues, but this is beyond compare.  Permission needed to have a beard or wear a veil at your wedding?  The press being allowed to print racist things about your wife? I’ve always wondered who really runs things in the palace…….now I know.  It’s definitely NOT the royal family."
TMarques,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His account of his life.,"So much has been written about Prince Harry, his whole life the tabloids and news in general reporting made up stuff…. This book is his right of an answer. These are his words and his point of view. He’s not a character of a story, he’s a real person, with real feelings and a real life.The same “critics” that don’t like the book are the ones who love a good gossip about the royal family. Now that Harry’s setting the record straight it’ll be hard for the people to believe in the nasty gossip that the media creates."
mrk,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry deserves admiration!,"Spare is a great read, deliciously written and from the heart.  Harry's struggles to deal with his mother's death and the press are tragic.  He talks lovingly and refreshingly about the Queen, his father, and William.  They should be proud of the man he has become, who stands for what he believes.  I admire and wish Harry and Meghan all the good the world has to offer.  They deserve kindness and respect.  Love wins."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"It's refreshing to see one of the royals be open about the royal juggling needed to survive in such an old institution. Harry is much like his mother, and not so full of himself, giving his view of growing up and trying to be a man instead of an afterthought. There's no revelation I was surprised by his side of the story. The media has much ado about nothing. There was nothing demeaning about the rest of his family in this book. A good read."
Niv Mani,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,insightful and kind hearted to the core.,"The book starts off with vistas as if seen from inside a moving vehicle, dots and dashes of memories of a loved one whose time came too soon, and  soon steadies its pace to offer a peek into a ‘privileged ‘ life of duty and grace under pressure , filled as it inevitably is, with imperfections that reside within every one of us. Draws open the curtains revealing the supposedly perfect blue bloods  and their bands of slavish toadies who masquerade as ‘journalists’. Any reader with a smidgen of conscience and decency can’t but wholeheartedly wish all the best for Prince Harry & his (immediate) family."
KJ,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyed far more than expected,"Harry’s story has been crafted and shaped in the media for so long with whatever versions of events best suited those who placed the stories… so its interesting and enjoying to hear ‘his’ version.  I know there are differing perspectives of all events most likely but he presents his story in a genuine fashion, with details and emotions that feel real.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read/listen and am glad I bought the book.  I hope Harry and Meghan are happy in America - we love to have them… flaws and strengthens combined, they sound like fascinating people in a rough situation that they have managed to escape as best they can."
Kelebmw,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truth,I wondered how I would feel before I read this. His words I truly believe is his truth. I think as he walks through the denial of the Firm to help defend them is truth. I through my best friend finally saw the hidden and not so hidden racism and I believe it happened to them. To pull all security when there were active death threats to their family is unforgivable. How could you not protect your child and grandchildren for any reason.
TCahn,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hoping this book brings Harry peace,"I purchased the Kindle edition with the audio narration by Harry himself, because I wanted to hear his voice in addition to reading his words. Remembering him most distinctly as the boy I saw walking behind his mother’s coffin, and following his complicated ascent into adulthood, I was curious if any of the revelations in this book would change my opinion of him.They didn’t.Harry, you may never see this, but there are many of us that have been in your corner for as long as we have known of you, and who always will support you. I am so sorry for what you have endured, and I hope that in telling your story you are able to process it and find the peace you deserve. Thank you for sharing it with us."
Linda R Artman,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,More than a Spare,"Harry didn't hesitate to point out his weaknesses, his problems, or his mistakes.

I recommend this book to anyone that believes "" they're lucky, they're Royal and have it all!"""
William de Rham,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,An intensely personal memoir with flaws.,"Prince Harry’s “Spare” is, in the truest sense of the word, a memoir.  Readers seeking to learn about Harry’s life and what he thinks and feels, or thought and felt, about the controversial events we’ve witnessed him experience will find much of interest.  However, readers hoping to learn about the monarchy and/or the Royal Family as institutions, or about the role they play in England’s national life, or about why the monarchy is important to England, the Commonwealth, and/or the rest of the world, may be disappointed.The book is intensely personal. Like many memoir writers, the prince concentrates on his experiences and relationships and his feelings about them: about his mother, father, brother, grandparents, etc; about what it feels like to be “the spare,” and to lose one’s mother, and to have to deal with the very press that chased that mother to her death and now seems hell-bent on holding you up to public ridicule every time you leave the house; and about serving in the British Army and going to war in Afghanistan, just to mention a few.Some of what he writes comes off as whiny, especially considering all the wealth and privileges that come with being a royal. Some of it comes off as disingenuous—or, at least, calculated to show Harry in the best possible light. Other parts come off as honest and genuine, especially when Harry writes about a true passion like the military or when he admits to his mistakes.What also comes through—as clear as a bell—is how difficult it is to be a royal, especially when it’s not a life you’ve chosen for yourself or for which you’re well-suited.  It’s a “fish-bowl” life in which the press and paparazzi treat the royals as “cash cows” and think nothing of turning the slightest misstep into the greatest of scandals or of completely fabricating stories to gain readership. That kind of scrutiny affects almost every decision a royal makes and every relationship he or she attempts to forge.  Harry has loads to say about the press and much of it deserves our attention.In sum, I found “Spare” to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, I enjoyed Harry's detailed descriptions of the places he’s been (from the grandest castles to the meanest villages), smiled at some of his charming, self-deprecating humor, and was touched by moments in his relationship with his father. On the other hand, I found some of the writing to be melodramatic, some descriptions of virtues and motives a little ""too good to be true,"" and some of his reporting unreliable. For example, some of the thoughts he describes himself as having as a child seemed, to me, all too adult.All in all, I thought ""Spare"" a three-star performance, meaning I liked it but had problems with it."
CC,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extraordinary Story,"Reading this book reconfirmed what I always thought about Prince Harry, that he is  an extremely caring  and loving human being! Helping others selflessly was his way. I wish his father would stop calling him ""Darling boy""!  It sounds degrading & sarcastic! The press has been so cruel and unrelenting.  No wonder Harry felt in order to protect his family that stepping away and moving away from the U.K. was necessary. So much criticism from the Brits! Shame on them!"
Fillis,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very interesting read,Thank you for enlightening me to all you have and continue to experience and I am sorry that you have had to live through this.

I’d seen the Crown on TV but I don’t follow the Royals like some people, so I don’t know why I picked this up. But once I did, there was no putting it down. It’s well written, it’s Suspenseful and exciting, touching and such endearing characters and immensely readable. I would recommend this book to just about anyone who likes to read and maybe to some who don’t.  Excellent."
Laura Drumm,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I felt his words are authentic,"I’ve never read a book on the royals, not even Diana. Harry was the first who ever raised any interest in the subject, probably because of the loss of his mother and the difficulty of never having your life to yourself. I believe his story is open and honest; I felt there was no great insults to his family members, just his truth. I wish he and his family will have a life of peace and love."

Bronx & Bougie,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This should’ve been first,The books should have come before the documentary and the Oprah Interview. It really highlighted so much of the dysfunction in his life long before he met Megan. Very brave and bold for him to embrace his truth and dispel the misconceptions and blatant lies. The way Harry described his mom was absolutely beautiful and one of the most moving parts.  I also downloaded the audio version to listen to and to hear him read this in his voice was positively worth it.

Better yet, I bought the audio book, so he told me the story himself - bonus! Fantastic Memoir, worthy of all the notoriety it has garnered.

The royal family members are bossed around by the zookeepers.  They get fed and dressed and leave the cage every so often to be viewed by the public when are out in the pen.  Harry paints a great picture of his life and whether you like his opinions or not, his book is full of his thoughts.  They don’t need to be debated.  He escaped the zoo and can now enjoy his freedom."
J. I. Wendlandt,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent read!!,"This feels very personal and true.  I can certainly understand his behavior after his mother died. That he managed to become his own man after being raised in the monarchy is amazing.  It doesn't surprise me that race is not an issue to him.  He loves Africa.  I hope he can reunite with his father, but it won't surprise me if he can't.  I just hope he will be a better father to his own children than his father was to him."
Reader,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Surprisingly Hood Read,"It's a serious read. I had no idea of all they went through at the hands of the British paparazzi; or that the Royal Family had this ridiculous unholy ""agreement"" with the tabloids and press. Really shines a light. There were a couple of private details he should have left out, because that is what the media is focusing on, instead of the real story which is the power of unsavory British press, as well as the power of longtime staff, and family leaks."
Lizbeth Gregg,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it,I’m glad I finally got to hear/read Harry’s side of what happened. How he met and fell in love with Meghan. And how long he’d been looking for his soulmate. The effects of losing his mother at such a young age and what he went through to start healing. The strange dynamics of being a part of the royal family and how public image is of more importance than family to some members. It was a great read!
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely stunning!,"Wow. What an amazing story of Prince Harry's life! Such a tragic, sad childhood. How is he even remotely normal? Beautifully written, it brought me to tears for him many times. I'm very very happy that he and Meghan and their children are safe and here in the US. I pray that they will continue to be safe and that some day he will have his father and brother back in his life in a loving relationship. Now I'm going to read it again!!!"
Cai Thorman,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well done.,"Candid, honest to his own perspective and memory, and forthright. Every eye-witness account is biased by definition. This one may be, but it is also intensely earnest. And surprisingly funny. Harry's personality comes through. He's not happy, and he has every right to not be. He did what he felt he needed to do to protect his family and survive. Whatever this book may be called by detractors or fans, there is absolutely no doubt that it is an important historical document."
Denise Dennis,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth the word,"I felt it was true and honest, to as far as he possessed that own honesty within himself. In many ways, this was a story about trauma and grief and it certainly connected. Very occasionally, I wondered if he still had some blinders on about some privilege or some action, but for the most part, I witnessed his own growth and ownership of what that journey entailed. I feel like we got a 1good look of who he is and I am holding back one star onlg for the occasional moment when I thought the coincidences and superstitions were laying it on too thick. But overall, worth the read."
MARY BARCELLONA,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hurrah for Harry (and for Megan too),"Thank you, Harry, for this informative book, allowing the world to know how very difficult life has been for you and for Megan also.  Please continue to love, trust and enjoy each other as fiercely as you now do, to cherish those two dear children, and to never allow any exterior force ( be it family, press or whatever) to control your life. Sending you and your sweet family some very American hugs!"
SVB,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Touching, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting","I hope everyone quick to condemn Harry and Meghan reads this book. This is Harry’s story as he experienced it, and it is powerful and heartbreaking. The trauma and heartbreak he has experienced in his life is extraordinary, made all the more unbearable by the relentless, horrific lies told about him and his wife by the predatory tabloids. This book is very well written and often brought me to tears. And it lifted the veil on life behind the palace walls."
Barbara,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry is an amazing person.,"I couldn't put Harry's book down.  I absolutely loved it.  I am so glad he wrote it and has found love and peace in his life.  So truthful and honest.  I am so glad that he is now able to keep his Meg and family safe in the wonderful, beautiful State of California.  What he went thru with the evil paps has now made him a stronger person.  His dedication as a soldier is so admirable.  Thank you Harry."
Kristin Ferris,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible read,"This book is incredible.I have never been famous. I always thought it a glamorous thing. Always wanting the fame. This book shows me that I have the perfect life. The family struggles are relatable. This book emotes so many feelings. This book is no spare. It is the real deal. You won't be disappointed. Im not going to lie I googled many words. The brittish lingo I know nothing of. Grab a glass of wine, the book and some time and be prepared to be astonished."
James Carlson,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare: The words of a Survivor of Royal Apathy,"Engaging. Informative. Eye opening. Controversial. Emotional. Truthfully and openly informing of the life, struggles, wishes, desires, and above all; who this person called Harry really is. Not just a Royal, not just a Prince, but a living breathing caring and loving human being so misunderstood. I truly suggest that all who want to know more about him, his life, his strength, his struggles, and most importantly his demons; read this book so candidly open and unflinchingly baring the soul of a true loving person."
Starfish,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry's Book Is Wonderful,"I loved this book, I really did.  It is a must-read for anyone even remotely interested in the royal family and specifically Harry's relationships within the family.  If you want to know the truth then read this book.What surprised me most was the beautiful style of writing.  I found myself mesmerized and so very impressed with every page.I hope he and his wife and children live a long and happy life."
B. Joan Shields,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare…a surprisingly good read!,"I had no expectations about this book but found Prince Harry’s story believable and compelling! In fact, the book was an easy read, very interesting, and hard to put down. I did come away after reading his story, with absolute total disgust for the control the print media has over the royal family. I guess it is the price one has to pay to be rich and famous but I don’t believe giving up your freedom is worth it."
eeb,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt,"I just finished the book and I’m sad it’s ended.  I think it’s time that one of the royals spelled out all the dysfunction in the Royal family, brought on them by the most unusual family dynamics, media pressures, hierarchy, etc.Maybe Harry’s work will pave the way for improvements for the youngest royals.  Hopefully the nonsense will end so Prince George can lead a more normalLife.  Changes are long overdue."
Marzieh Savoj,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best memoir I have ever read,I read a few reviews prior to reading the book myself but none truly did justice.  The context matters a lot.  This is not a revengeful story and you do not have to be from an elite family to relate.  This is the story of how to find your place in life when your loved ones are unable to see your suffering and potentials.  Highly recommend reading it.
S. Bonneville,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting,I find this book to be a true account of the Royals. Not surprisingly disgusting going back to Princess Diana.  Had she not been killed by paparazzi in 1997 maybe but I say maybe things would have been different for Harry. I commend him on the bravery it took to write this book and only hope and pray he and his family can have a somewhat normal life without the interference of the Royals  and their bizarre life style and character.
Mihaela Morozan,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is so intense!,"I am still waiting for my book! I couldn’t wait so I downloaded it on Audible. I am so happy I was able to hear his part of the story. I am tired of the British Media’s dirt. This is his truth and I am here for it!We are always dreaming about this and that, maybe being in their shoes, having a good life, or just being a princess or a prince, but this book confirms that freedom and love are the most precious things in life!I’ve always loved Harry, he is a kind soul!He is Diana’s living spirit!He has the right to tell his truth, his storyWe have the right to know the truth!"
memyselfandi,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soul-bearing and heartbreaking.,"I am overcome with sadness. A boy born into a world that places ""appearances"" over everything. Harry didn't choose to be born a prince. But he chose his wife and family over the archaic workings of The Firm. So proud of him. His mother's son, he has so much to teach the world. I, for one, hear the words from his mouth. Press on Harry. You are supported and deserving of a life filled with love."
Ameenah,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,well done heart-wrenching truth,"With many moments of tears, this book is so well done.  Such a gift from the Prince to the world - sharing his life struggles.  The feelings convey to the reader and I find myself reading cover to cover.I am sure his mother felt so many similar feelings and so happy the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are striving for the peace and happiness they and their children deserve.  Thank you, Prince Harry, for this book."
Chloe Faith Wordsworth,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heroic and courageous journey,"A beautifully written book - a hero's journey, like Odysseus trying for years to reach home, facing one obstacle after another and overcoming. Harry is authentic and honest. You can see that his priority is truth - truth about himself, his mistakes, his loneliness, his family, the media, but also his friends and his love story with Meghan. And there's humour too - bowing to Queen Victoria's statue on the way to bed, the Queen getting ""cross"" if she didn't have an hour of fresh air each day. And there's sadness that brings tears.Why oh why didn't the media embrace Harry and Meghan: beautiful, loving, caring, wanting to make a difference - making a difference! FINALLY a good article in the Guardian by Kate Williams, a historian - but why did the Guardian hide it away, instead of promoting yet more negative responses from various cynical journalists? Of all newspapers, I expected better of the Guardian.Harry has a certain brilliance - what it took to be one of the few to train as an Apache pilot! His capacity to overcome pain: walking 6-8 miles with no skin on his feet, going to the south pole with a broken toe.And his courage in speaking his truth in this book - and the courage that allowed him and Meghan to make it through.There is something in this book for everybody - those who have been abused, faced the death of a loved one, been wounded physically or mentally, those in pain. And there is also hope: the joy of living - a loving family, humour and compassion.This book is a page turner. Intense but well worth the reading."
DAN,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shockingly good - this from a lot major,"Prince Harry’s memoir is compelling and introspective.  Contrary to headlines and other reviews, I don’t think any person looks bad, but the relationship the monarchy has with the tabloid media is awful and is very damaging to all within the system.  I hope Harry finds what he seeks - his father and brother again, outside the institution.  I don’t have high hopes for this, however, considering how much the monarchy depends upon the media in order to exist."
Tinya,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and fluid read. Packed full of emotion. Worth the purchase!,"This is a wonderfully well written story of Prince Harry's life from his own mouth. No one discount an individuals own personal experiences, feelings, thoughts, fears, relations and emotions. After 38 years of being harassed, lied about, mistreated (abused) and silenced. It has been wonderful to read the truth, Harry's truth as he remembered it. Excellent read. I'm now going to purchase the audio version as well to hear Harry read it himself. Well done, Prince Harry! Congratulations 🎉🎊"
Anita L. Lebeau,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt Read,"Beautifully written and spoken.  It was nice to read a story straight from the source and not from the BS spread from the BRITISH Press/Tabloids.  I was moved to hear about his military life and I feel for Harry and Megan.  I commend Prince Harry for standing up for himself and protecting his family.  Prince Harry, I for one welcome you to America and hope you stay."
Lindsey Cordell,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it. Changed my whole perspective on who the bad guys are.,"I was prepared to continue thinking Meghan had ruined Harry's life. After watching the Netflix documentary and reading this book, I honestly don't know how they lasted as long as they did. Harry is very careful not to overtly throw his family under the bus, at the same time showing how ""mind controlled"" they all are. Its surprisingly serious yet funny at the same time. Highly unlikely anyone will answer Harry's book with one of their own."
Anonymous,Reviewed in India on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and honet,"After reading this book, everything that I ever imagined about royals - kings, queens, princesses, princes- their fabulous lives and palaces was just imagined. Reality is quite different. I couldn't help but feel for Harry and his story, being at the receiving end of constant and invasive public scrutiny at every stage of his life. It takes great courage to stand up for yourself, but even greater for other people and recognise that what is happening is wrong. Men around the world are ingrained to believe that taking a stand for their wives, would label them ""henpecked"". But Harry has set a precedent and has stood up to the bullies.  Every person has the right to say their peace and be done with it. I hope this experience helps him heal, live a fuller life, and one day reunite with his whole family and be happier."
Lisa A. Miller,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartbreaking, but necessary read","You cannot read this without feeling gutted by the way these families have been taught to live. No hugs, no kisses, no love. Diana would have been mortified  at the treatment of her baby boy, and it STILL continues. Kudos to Harry and Meghan for deciding what was right for THEIR family. I wish them love, peace, strength and understanding, as well as long, joy- filled lives, raising their children to be loving, productive human beings."
Adam Masters,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is NOT how the press presents it,"This book was excellent, it was personal, it was revealing. Throughout the book you see how the loss of his mother affected his whole life. This is just recollections or his life, his memories. It’s not a book of secret telling or finger pointing. It’s about a boy who tragically lost hit mother, had a distant non-emotional father, a brother he was at odds with but loved, a grandmother he loved and honored and a clear explanation of how and why he hates the British press. But what stood out to me most was a life story of love. Love for his brother, for his father, for his grandmother and even for his step mother who made his father happy. But my favorite part, was it was a about a man who found true love and conquered every obstacle not to lose that love and even against the British monarchy he fought. He left his home, his family, his country, for true love, ti have a family. This man deserves the happiness he found. Just because he’s privileged, doesn’t mean he doesn’t experience the same emotions we do, he can’t help the world or family he was born into. I took balls to wire this and I hope they live happily every after. So good, highly highly recommended. And yes parts did make me cry. He’s just a pain in pain, healing and wanting a life like the rest of us"
Jeanette Barnes,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful memoir,"Great book and it really helped me. I suffer PTSD from childhood trauma and relate to a LOT. Including how he lived before seeking help. It makes me want to get therapy and I think I will.Also, good for him for finding love. He found someone who loves to hug and he often states how it’s something he longed for and a family that loves him dearly."
Sean J. Malloy,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The world through a Prince’s eyes,"Enjoyed the book. Most ‘royal’ books are like ufo books…lots of padding with little meat.But our Harry’s book is solid meat with scenes future historians will love if only for the Prince’s detail of hallways and rooms where the famous have stalked for centuries.And, no matter the pitiful palace hysterics, Harry’s father comes off rather well, imperfect but loving. The others…not so much.Great read if you are into this stuff. Highly recommend!"
BayRidgeGirl,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well done Harry,"Any negative reviews must come from the other side.  I'm the odd guy out in my very unroyal family, and I am glad Harry chose to live his life and like Meghan said, it's their story ""shouldn't they tell it"".  Funny, if a few people would just say ""hey, I'm sorry"" all this drama would vanish.  I didn't buy the audiobook, however, I could hear Prince Harry's voice telling his story.  Tooks guts to take this path.  Bravo."
Deb Steph,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Read,"Don't go into this book with a love him or hate him attitude.  Open your ears to hear the words of his soul, the struggles he and his immediate family have overcome and the thanks he shares with those that have made him the person he is today.  Best wishes to you and your family Harry.  Your Mummy is very proud of you and your Granny is still giggling as she smiles down on you."
S B,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling!,"I purchased the book and audio book because I like to have the option of listening. I haven’t been able to stop listening to his book today. 5hrs in and I’ve laughed, cried, and everything in between. Harry is nothing like what I expected given the news articles I’ve read over the years about him. He’s so much more. He’s a human being. Flawed, introspective, witty, intelligent, honest. Highly recommend even if you’re not a royal watcher, of which I’m not."
Louise Stevenson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling,"Well, I've finished H's book and definitely needed a lie down afterwards. It's beautifully written and evokes the full spectrum of emotions from pity to rage.  There is no question that this ""boy"" was failed in the years following his mother's 'hunt to her death"".It gives a rare insight into Royal life, its outdated protocols and traditions and also to what little power they actually have compared to their Equerries and Advisors (that really stunned me!).Whilst he does ""mump"" quite a lot ( which I suggest he stops), he does have a genuine warmth and humanitarian compassion that is so often faked today.  His love for, and from,  his father is tangible but unfortunately William, Camilla and Kate don't feature quite so well.The King comes across as a gentle, kind man and a scholar who, also, has been emotionally stunted if not deprived during his formative years. And a man who is very much misunderstood.The overriding theme, however, is the British Press who should be thrown through the gates of hell for their actions.  No amount of money, privilege or fame is worth what their victims endure.  Shameful doesn't even cut it.I like Harry very much, I like the Royal family very much and despite what a lot of the general public say, they actually generate more income than they cost.  Were they a subsidiary of a business, you would keep that department, as they actually generate profit!However, they have faults like any other family and splits and rifts to boot.  Unfortunately their's are played out  under the microscope of the media.His military career definitely gave him an true sense of family and camaraderie which he holds dear to this day.  His war stories are compelling and touching and the friendships he forged during those years, leave you feeling,  will last a lifetime.I won't touch on Meghan as I feel that's something everyone needs to appraise personally.However, whist I understand why he's done this - it won't light his way home and for that I am truly sorry.  This is a young man who misses his family and almost yearns for an acceptance I don't link he ever truly had.I wish them well, but I am left with a deep disquiet....If you do start to read it, I urge you to finish - as I felt very differently at the epilogue as I did half way through."
Al,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reads exceptionally well,"Didn't know what to expect, but this reads as well as any entertaining work of fiction, while being a non-fiction book. Most biographies I've read were so compartmentalized and didn't feel organic. This starts at the beginning and tells a rich, detailed story for with love, adventure, tragedy, betrayal and hope.

I enjoyed every moment of it and finished it in 2-3 days. I don't see how this is him airing our the family's dirty laundry but I see his people can be any at him though I don't think it's warranted.

I am left with a sad feeling of loss for a family that is intrinsically broken, and what waste the institution has made of its relationships.

Real freedom for he and his family."
Lora Marie,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,"This book is an honest, non family bashing story as told from Prince Harry's perspective.  I appreciated the fact that this was not about bashing his family or the royalty of England.  It is an easy read; it was like sitting down and having a conversation between the writer and the reader.  This is not usually my type of book but I found myself intrigued by the premise.  I did enjoy it."
Marty,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Spare, with no reason to lie.","I liked this book because I think Harry is being truthful. He confessed to the things he did in his youth and in college. Harry has a good heart and is following in the footsteps of his mother. How painful it must be to have your family turn on you, and let the papers say such horrible things about your wife and children., and never come to your defense."

Moira dickson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Is this an honest account?,"This is an easy book to read. It dispels some of the myths that the media have spread.  It is mainly about his school days and his military career. He recollects some things about his mother, who is clearly a constant in his life. He clearly loves his Pa and Willy but with constant friction - but how much of that is caused by the courtiers and the media. There are always two sides and there are elements that Harry did not make things easy either. The overwhelming picture to me is someone who has been traumatized for most of his live and dealing with his mental health as a result. I wish his, Meghan and their child a good and happy life together.  There are a few scenarios that are quite raw and I don't think he should have shared as much and I also think talking about the killings was an error. It's Harry's account of what he  believes took place, it's his truth and I think there is a lot of truth, perhaps one or two things happened slightly differently. It's his honesty and integrity that some people may question there are only 6 people in this picture who know"

How the Heir puts his needs and wants above his family, the country, and betrays the trust of his own brother. Truly insightful and so terribly sad.

It was so well written, Harry was so vivid in his depictions of war, not only overseas, but at home. I had no idea his life was so difficult. I found parallels to my own life in his stories and I wished I cooked reach out and offer him comfort. I hope Charles and William see all the pain they’ve caused, and are still causing, through their inaction."
Sloane,Reviewed in Australia on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth they hype,"Completely captivating from beginning to end, detailing far more wide-ranging aspects of Harry's life and insights into the British royal family than I envisioned. I know it was ghost written by a brilliant memoirist, but the stories were all Harry's and he gave us an unflinching account of his life. He's not playing a victim; he was treated very differently from his brother his whole life, by family, brother and media, like an inferior strain of calf culled and separated from the herd, and left to survive on their own. Or, as if Harry was only bred to provide organ donation for his sibling and worthless otherwise. He is a human being entitled to a full, happy life as much as anyone!He found such worthwhile purpose in the Army, which I think prepared him far better for life than his father did, but the family decided it wasn't appropriate for him to continue, and at that point he may have continued to flounder. It is the Universe, and his mother, who brought Meghan into his life to be his soul partner. They are made for each other and they nourish each other's purpose. I wish them every success."

FunnyPatS,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,What happens at the palace doesn’t stay at the palace,"I was a bit skeptical when starting this book. I did watch the documentary on Netflix so I knew the book was going to be harsh when it came to the royal family. Except for a little self pity here and there the book was good and I feel a truthful representation of what Harry and Megan went thru. I think the bottom line was Charles/ Camilla wanted no one to upstage them, especially a young, beautiful American actress. The world was in love with Harry & Megan and I think Charles and William did whatever they could to destroy the competition. A sad story I’m many ways but humorous at times and honest feelings throughout"
CF,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare by Prince Harry,"Great read. Beautiful writing and storytelling  - on par with President Ulysses Grant's autobiography and ""The Warmth of Other Sun by Isabel Wilkerson."" Each gives you a window into the intimate lives of a people, a country in transition, and reasons for migration/immigration at a unique time in history. And, all leave an indelible mark on the reader for agreeing to take the journey with the author. Well done!"
An astute shopper,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating and eye-opening!,"I just received Spare from Amazon today. Purposely  had an early dinner, told my husband he’s on his own with tv tonight, and curled up in my favorite chair and started reading. Cannot put this book down!! Even though I’ve heard a lot about it in the media, once you get caught up in Harry’s writing, you start hanging on every word! I commend him for revealing so much about his unique life. Highly recommend this once-in-a-lifetime book!"
Mary,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"I never trusted the paps as Harry calls them, and I have always felt bad for the people they harass.  Reading this book confirmed that.  Hearing Harry's side of his life, hearing the truth, left me so sad.  This book was hard to put down, definitely worth reading.  I truly hope that in writing this, it helped him heal from all that he has been through!"
Randy Hicks,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written and difficult to put down,"Prince Harry has told his story in stunning detail, the highs and lows. Self depreciating at times and delightfully funny, he transitions back and forth between amusing anecdotes and traumatic events. He doesn't shy away from controversial or incriminating topics, he lays his soul bare. Finally, after a lifetime of obeying his family's instruction to stay silent, Harry gets to share his truth. He has grown into an admirable man...his mother would be proud."
Cindie Schooner-Ball,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare Truth,"Thank you Prince Harry for writing this book.I, like many wondered how life would turn  out for you after watching the tragedy unfold for all the world to witness.Honestly your eloquent writing, bare bones truth telling of family not so pretty secrets surprised me.You paid a hefty price for happiness, which all of us, including Royal's deserve.And I hope people read this book with an open mind and heart, a and not believe tabloid trash."
Lynne rosenthal,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent insight,"I found myself experiencing everything from giggles to tears and hurt for Prince Harry. He and his ghost writer did an excellent job giving insight into how life as a royal affected he and his family. Harry was no longer on the untouchable pedestal, he was right beside me, sharing feelings and experiences. He became human with some of the same issues we have all faced in one way or another. Thank you!"
B. J. Wassmer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Royal Recounting,"I must thank Harry for setting us straight on the details of his life so far. He made me feel the angst, the intensity but mostly the love he has endured. I felt his desire to set the record in truth through his eyes and that is all each one of us can do with our own story. Keep up your charitable work Harry. Make a difference in the world! Godspeed. You are a credit to your beloved mother Diana."
Trina Spivey,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Team Harry 1,000%%%%","I always say unless you’ve walked in any person’s shoes, they have the right to express their pain and issues in whatever manners is necessary as long as it does not cause irreparable harm to others.  Harry is expressing himself; something the rest of the royals should do.  There’s a lot of healing needed across all parties. It hurts me to see the brothers with a strained relationship but it’s normal among siblings unfortunately.  Had Diana still been here things would different;  her love and maternal instincts are definitely missed and you can see it.  The ones in the palace are like cold stones and it shows.  I respect Harry for standing his ground; I’ve watched him grow and mature and while he’s still growing I could tell long ago he would not be William’s shadow.  Older siblings can be bullies and all knowing- I am one as well.  A change is needed and Harry is taking the first steps into modern change; it takes a strong person to venture away from royalty-  but I believe William may envy his brother’s freedom just a bit.I do wish them all well and will pray for peace and neutral healing among all parties but some are just too sheltered, close minded.  Keep your head up Harry and protect yours."
Lori N,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A surprise in many ways,"Initially, I was disappointed Harry resorted to a public grievance about the bout with his family.  And while it is that, and a path I wouldn't take, it is fascinating to read about true royal life behind the scenes.  I know very well there are two sides to every story, and Will's would shed light Harry couldn't portray. It's still fascinating to hear one side and I'm happy Harry is doing well.  Worth a read."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful reading!,"Great book that really goes into his feelings about his mother and her death and the lifelong grief and the lies of the press and how they endanger many people in their quest for a story be it true or false, his feelings of being considered the Spare, and the unfeeling intricacies of being a Royal. Great read and I hope he has found his path and is happy and free!!!"

It’s one of the best books I’ve ever read. From the very first sentence to the last line , I was intrigued by his story. how detailed it was, so clear. It was like watching a movie . I cried  a few times, laughed, prayed for his family to help him. I prayed for their safety. Instead of believing the hate against them, give his memoir a chance ."
Michelle R,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved hearing Harry's persective!,"I read this book in a few days. I couldn't put it down. I didn't find it gossipy or whiney as Harry has been called. I am not a fan of royalty or of Harry or Meghan, just a fan of inner peace. Family discord, mental health issues, substance abuse, hurt, shame, lonliness, abandonment and grief are many of the huministic emotions that we share, whether we come from the palace or pauper."
ann m. armstrong,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a decent read, but nothing to write home about","Maybe it's because the media covered so many of the juicy tidbits prior to the book being released to the general public; but there weren't many surprises.  I felt that too much time was spent on Harry's military experience.  I guess as an ""inquisitive reader"", I was looking for more of the personal interactions with the family.  That being said, I do think the book was healing for Harry and Meghan to write.  We always knew the Royal Family put the Monarchy over their family.  Nothing new there.  Still, it was a good read."
Carolyn LaBille,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I thought,"Open, honest and candid. One gets a feel for how the Prince thinks and sees the world. The world of Royalty and family business is not a place most would thrive, and he didn't. Better off as his own man, not being jabbed at by a brother who is stuck and a father who is finally in the chair. Would never want to be in their shoes."
Marjorie B. Richter,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing,"Everyone has their own opinion about what is truth. This is a refreshing look at Harry and Megan’s life. It is very sad to see that power and greed has divided this family especially after all that they have suffered with the loss of their mother. Thank you, Harry, for sharing this.  You are strong and wise and have a beautiful soul. I wish you the peace and happiness that you both deserve."
Homebaker in DC,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A touching recollection of his life in his own words,"When I started reading the book, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’ve known the general story of Harry’s life over the years based on media reports and didn’t think much of it. This book however has been an eye opener. He bares his life, describes his struggles in a beautiful and poignant way. Also love the way he explains his own mental health struggles giving hope to others. This book is a must read."
Tiffany Silverberg,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tragic.,"I don’t follow the royal family, but I like memoirs, so I picked it up. It appears that most people don’t sympathize with a prince, no matter how valid his complaints. Unlike the big celebrities, Harry didn’t choose the spotlight, he was born into it.  So what I learned from reading his account is that the royals are as dysfunctional as the rest of us, and that the British press is absolutely vile."
John Harvey,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The other side of the story,This book is easy to read and gives you a first-hand look at what it is like to be Prince Harry.  People are trashing this book without reading it.  Just taking tidbits out of context.  I encourage you to read it before making judgements.  Of course truth has many sides and beholders.  Nice to get a take on the other side.
Shay,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare by Prince Harry is beautifully written.,"Prince Harry book is beautifully written. This book is about surviving hate, his time in military, friendships and finding his soulmate. I enjoyed the book and I also have the audio version. I felt like I was in the room with him while he read. Prince Harry voice is wonderful. I wish Prince Harry and his beautiful wife, son and daughter all good things in the world. 🧿⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't put this book down. Best book I've read in years, well actually,  EVER.","As an American it's hard for me to comprehend how this could happen to someone anywhere. The British press has really only itself to blame for the death of more than just a princess. The death of relationships and joyful moments is a tragedy.I've never asked myself, ""Who would protect me?"" more than I have reading this book. I am confident my answer would be my family. I honestly believe there is great love between Prince Harry and his family. But I also agree silence can be a betrayal.Thank you to Prince Harry for sharing your story with the world. And, I thank your wife for giving you the strength to do it."
Calista S.,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A true “must read”! An incomparable view from inside the dysfunctional British royal family.,"As an avid reader of autobiographies and memoirs, as well as a lifelong “royal watcher”, I have to say that this is the most interesting, humble, and honest memoir that I have ever read. I can’t endorse it highly enough. Prince Harry is truly an inspiration for telling the hard truth about his own life, after having been deliberately misrepresented by the tabloids and palace press office his entire life. A must read!"
Roma Hergott,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartwarming and sincere,"‘Spare’ was so heartwarming, full of light wit and amazing detail. Over 400 pages seemed as if it would be very long, but I enjoyed every minute of reading it. Having loved Princess Diana, it was  so important to me to hear how Harry finally started to come to terms with her death. I am so glad that he has found such deep happiness and fulfillment with Meghan and his 2 beautiful children."
Bookmom,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bravo Harry,"I admit that I admired Princess Diana.  I used to cut out pictures of her from magazines and glue them in a book.  I was heartbroken when she died - and cried at seeing her sons walking behind her casket.  I loved William and Kate and watched their wedding live.  I did the same for Harry and Meghan.  As an American, I was not exposed to the sheer amount of tabloid insanity that they endured.I enjoyed reading Harry's story.  I am sure there is another side.  However, I do not think that Harry gains anything by embellishing his story.  You can sense his hurt in the book.  And what shocked me the most - and made me sad - is that the bond between William and Harry turns out to be a myth.I hope that Harry and Meghan can finally get a life that is dictated by their desires."
Maggie M,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting Reaad,I found the book very interesting to read. I wanted to form my own opinion of the book rather than read the reports printed in the press. It gave quite an in depth insight of how the monarchy operates within the Royal Palaces. It also puts across how traumatic it was for Prince Harry to make the long walk behind the cortege of his mother's funeral which seems to have impacted on the rest of his life.
Kristin,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,I Do Feel Bad For Him,"I live in America where, if you care about anything royal, you either hate Meghan passionately or put her on a saint-like pedestal. Zero in between. I never learned their full reasons for leaving Royal life until I read this, and tried to go about it with as unbiased opinion as I could.It's a couple hour read, I was able to complete it over two days.Where it's good: I enjoyed the comedic approach and honesty to making it clear he is not a perfect human being. He's just trying to live his best life, make the most of his role in the family, and keep some sort of sense of self in a world where, the self is lost in duty.Where it's grey: It is completely clear from the beginning to the end of the 400 or so pages, that he has absolutely not recovered or moved on well from the death of his mother. Her shadow is felt in nearly every page, as though her death occurred a week ago and not when he was still a boy. He's still grieving, actively grieving. On top of the royal drama, he writes extensively of his time serving in the Royal Army. Clear PTSD shines through his experiences with the regular world in England when he returns.Where it's bad: I never would have realized William was such a negative force in his life. He spent a few or so pages claiming to be completely fine with being ""the Spare"", but it's maliciously obvious he isn't. Bitter anger and pettiness pour from his words about his father, his brother, and even Kate. If the things that he wrote are true, he holds onto them like grudges, instead of trying to move on from them after his departure from his Royal role. Something he claims they (William and Kate) do in spades. In short, it comes across as no one is really the good guy here.Meghan? Meghan I might have a shred of pity for, especially if she did in fact, try to make friends in that world. Diana made it clear when she was alive it was difficult to find genuine love and companionship in that world. I feel perhaps she thought she could handle or withstand that kind of world, but bit off more than she could chew.All I can say is I hope Harry and his family can simply move on with their lives if it's truly that terrible, and I hope Harry can get some sort of trauma therapy and be well; let go of the anger he clearly keeps as recently as the Queen's death."
boomerj,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A different perspective,"The story overall is compelling.  there are many stories within this biography. While there may be a few questions as to whether or not some of his recollections are accurate, his version needed to be told.  Most interesting was his accounts of his military service.  He tells of his  flaws and mistakes , but also the strange and difficult life and sometimes dangerous life  in the royal family.  He shares his concerns for the safety of his famliy, while continuing to support many  charities.  Its also a great love story"

Erica W. Swenson,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare review,"This book was amazingly honest and coompassionate.

Shuni,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A balanced & well written account of an extraordinary life journey.,"I loved this book! It wasn't what I was expecting - I had seen media articles slating Harry,  the book, the couple etc., and I expected to find reason for that within its pages but what I found was an un sensational (in the best possible way) narrative of a child's struggle to 'become' someone of value [to himself as much as anyone] in such strange, and painful, family circumstances.This is a book that must be read with an open mind - because it's so well balanced, the reader will find sections that support whatever bias (if any) they approach with.The books shines a more favourable light on Charles as a Father which surprised me and nowhere in the book does he demonize anyone, with the possible exception of a couple of papperazi.It really is just Harry's story, no frills, no bells & whistles, just his account of circumstances - simply colouring in the missing or fuzzy sections and shining a light on some very dark and disturbing corners of the media,  and of the institution surrounding, but not part of, the Family.An excellent read!"
Colin,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"I’m glad I read this book.

He gets to tell his truth and if people don’t like it too bad. Camilla and Charles deserve each other.
Patricia Hall,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A sad commentary on a monarchy,"When I watched him being interviewed ad nauseam on multiple shows, repeatingthe whining almost verbatim, I thought Harry really was a wimp.

Ray Wiltshire,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartfelt, honest and sets the record straight","Prince Harry has at last set the record straight about all the misconceptions, smears and lies that have plagued his life. After over 40 books have been written about him by people who don't know him, we finally have an accurate account from the man himself, warts and all. He's very honest about his struggle to cope with losing his mother, being treated as second best by his family, being sent to a school where he was way out of his academic comfort zone, turning to drugs, and losing girlfriends because of the intense press scrutiny. The hate that has been thrown at him and Meghan is unprecedented and it's all thanks to the UK press not accepting a mixed race American actress as Harry's wife and the royal family resenting her popularity. It should be a national scandal that some palace courtiers and senior family members colluded with the British press to discredit and destroy Meghan, but because all our news is channelled through these very same publications it will never be investigated. Harry and Meghan are good, honest people trying to help others in the world. Now the world can see and read their story, hopefully the royal family will at least apologise and try to make amends."
kindy,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! Loved it.,"I loved this book.  Hooray for Harry and Meghan, recognizing the true meaning of life and love.  I too grew up in a family where the woman was a stronger figurehead than the man. Totally understood the jealousy involved with this family.  It started with his dad and Diana. Charles was not secure enough to overcome it, but instead passed it onto his eldest son. I’m sure the same will happen with Willy’s sons. The class system is the worst."
lilysmum,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Melancholy and moving,"I have purchased this book from Amazon and read it in its entirety. I feel that to comment on this book you should have read it; not just read excerpts in the press. The excerpts in the press don’t create a representative impression of how the book comes across. There are some reviewer comments that the book “rants” or is like a “drunk text”; it’s not like that at all, in my opinion, and I’ve read the book carefully over the last two days. It has left me with a feeling of sadness.Spare is a melancholy book about loss, grief, and the search for purpose in life. JR Moehringer is a skilled memoirist, and although I had concerns about a ghost written book, I need not have worried. There are some truly dreadful celebrity memoirs out there. This isn’t one of them. The book is very well written, and the short chapters hang together well. It must have taken a long time to craft it and draw out the themes. It begins with Princess Diana’s death, and takes in Harry’s life up to and just after the death of the Queen last September. The small details were fascinating - these were not the passages pulled out by the press and in some cases quoted out of context.I found myself moved by Prince Harry’s mother’s untimely death once again and it’s really hard to imagine how it must feel to lose your mum and know she was photographed in her final moments. Although I’ve always felt like that, I felt reading Harry’s own words helped me understand the PTSI he suffered at that time and in the years following more thoroughly. He’s very honest and candid in his descriptions of his emotions and indeed numbness after her loss. It’s a wonder that he has survived, given the pressures he has been under.  At one point Harry looks at the gardens of Sandringham and says “this place is a Paradise.  Why can’t we just enjoy it?” It’s very sad that he has lost contact with his family and I hope they are reconciled at some point. I wish him and his family happiness, and above all peace."
Melissa Duncan,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Anyone who’s ever lost anyone, can relate to Harry’s powerful story.","To say Harry went out on a cliff to tell and publish his own story, is an understatement. His entire life, TMZ and the British tabloids haven’t minded giving us their versions. I admire Harry. I truly had no idea this book would be this encompassing, but it’s masterfully written. I hope his family actually reads it, not just the leaked pain points, and tries to get the underlying message here."
Lexya,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bold memoir,"Well written, captivating, and thoughtful. People will say what they will, but one cannot ignore the importance of a world famous person processing childhood trauma so publicly, acknowledging generational trauma, and setting boundaries around toxic family dynamics. It provides inspiration for others to do the same. His whole life was on a world stage, so it seems to make sense that he is now sharing his story on his own terms to the world. So far, though, it doesn't do enough to address the institutionalized racism of the monarchy. The author says he doesn't have issue with the monarchy itself, but the monarchy has been responsible for such terror in the world, so..."

Peace be upon you.Everyone should read this book because it’s amazing. The life of being Royal is horrible. I glad he got out and I pray the others change before it’s too late."
Delores Edwards,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding memoir,"Prince Harry has told his story, --- his thoughts, struggles, experiences, celebrations, in other words, his life story. That is what a memoir is! I found it honest, open, warm, thoughtful  and at times humorous and sad.  I enjoyed it immensely and found I really like Harry and Megan. I wish them well and feel they are going to do great service throughout their lives."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,"A well-written navigation of shared family experiences and Harry's self discovery and emotional growth laced with his quick wit and humour.  A surprisingly interesting relationship between father and son culminating with disappointment when his father was needed.  A soldier, a husband, and a Dad protecting his immediate family and even those who failed to protect him. Harry, son of Diana, is a decent man. Excellent read."
Pat,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good of an autobiography as you will find.,"I wish the Prince and his family well. And I thank him for the insights into his life. We have all seen so many press reports but never understood, as the press was in a feeding frenzy with the royal family. Harry comes clean, to the bone, about his mother, father, brother, his military service, his loves, Meg. Honestly, I found the not-salacious parts more fascinating, particularly his military service. Bravo."
VABeachgirl,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a good read!,"I really did not want to put this book down once I started it. Harry is a masterful writer and is very adept at describing his surroundings and setting the scene to make you feel as you're right there with him. I hope this book was cathartic for him to write and finally tell his side of the story. I disagree with the people who say he bashes his family. I just think he shows them as being victimized by the press just as much as he is. It's a wonderfully written narrative, and very interesting.  May have to read it again or get the audio version to hear him read it."
Ginny,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally the truth and a happy ending,"I enjoyed this well written book very much. Harry is surprisingly open about his life, especially given how he was raised, but you can see a LOT of his mother in him. He is generous, kind, sensitive, a loving husband and a caring father. I wish all the best for him and Meghan and their family. They deserve to be happy and at peace. You are welcome here in America, respected and loved."
Kathleen E Craig,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly open.,"Well written, you can hear Harry’s voice in it. At times surprising that he went all the way ‘there’ commenting on everything we’ve ever read about him and his life from his paternity to his partying. Honest while admitting it’s just his perspective and there are other sides to the story. Sad for the loss of his family and hope they can heal in time."
feebee,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Insightful read,"This biography to anyone who's a fan of royalty or anyone who just wants insight into behind the scenes of royal life. This story appeals to anyone who's been through grief & loss, who's lived a life filled with love, adventure (big & small), travel, family, been a pet owner, parent, child or had struggles with their family - so it appeals to a wide range of readers. Wonderful dissection of mental health issues and the inner turmoil we all face in life. Took me 11 days to read while on summer holidays. Highly recommend."
Jean Carroll,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moving,I don’t know what I was expecting but this book sheds a lot of light on Harry and his family. My heart goes out to him and I pray he and Meghan and their children find peace. I know this is Harry’s account and I’m sure that King Charles and Prince William will disagree with portions but this is Harry’s story and he has every right to it.
Bobbie hanvey,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can take Harry out of the Royal but you can’t take the Royal out of Harry.,"Amazon UK promised I would have Spare on the 10th of January and it arrived on the 10th of January. Thank you Jeff!Spare is a beautifully written, happy, yet sad book with no index at the back or no chapter running order at the beginning. Harry tells us about his happiest times in the Big House and in the Army and of his dad being the best dad he could be. Don’t forget Harry, your dad’s childhood wasn’t the most idyllic either and like most human beings he was as lost as the rest of us. Don’t knock the man who suffered as much as you did.And as for your publisher, allowing your confession of killing 25 Taliban soldiers to be included in the book, shows they had no interest in your future welfare whatsoever and that profit for them was more important than your future safety. You must have read Kipling’s poem, The Young British Soldier!Your book tells a good story but now that you have told it, move on. Your complaining reminds me of the Irishman who asked the Jew, ‘Why do you Jews always answer a question by asking another question?’ The Jew replied, ‘Why shouldn’t we?’I predict you will return to the fold because whether you realise it or not, it’s where you belong."

Harman,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Raw, honest view of his narrative!","I thought it was raw, honest, well written and gets to the point of so many areas of his life. I can see why he’s where he’s at. He’s born as a spare. A spare kidney. It’s horrible to hear that and be numb to it. I think he’s living his best life and proving he can break away from conformity. I think he’s making Diana proud!!!"
Jo Ann ,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Autobiography!,"This book is an excellent read from the first page to the last. It’s three part covers Harry’s life from sad  and lonely young boy, to a stand out military officer, full time working Royal, and finally a loving, protective and happy husband and father. I recommend readers take their time reading this book and savor every word! I loved it and am already rereading it."

Peggy Lee Ball Fugal,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Two—or more—sides to every story,"I liked hearing Harry’s side of the story—minus the press, his father, Wills, and even Meghan. I like that his was a real love story. I despise Charles and Camilla for what they did to this family, to these boys, who were little more than orphans once their mother died. I admire Harry for following in his mother’s footsteps to freedom. I doubt the monarchy will survive the passing of QEII. There is nothing royal about Charles or Camilla. And Wills behavior surprised me. So very sad, so incredibly dysfunctional—and for what—to preserve a blood line of cold cruelty?"
Janeite,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Modern-day “Catcher in the Rye”—An Instant Classic,"Prince Harry may have exceeded his original intentions in writing this autobiography. Poignant, wise, witty, humble, honest, heartbreaking, incisive, this book offers insight not just into his gross mistreatment from the press, but into the rich and complex emotional life of a grieving teenage boy.  This may be our generation’s “Catcher in the Rye”— and  certainly at times is a much clearer take on the hypocrisy children face from the adult world.  Notable also are his descriptions of unexpected warmth and kindness from adults when it was least expected and much needed.  Prince Harry is clearly a gifted communicator with profound emotional and verbal intelligence.  Parents may have a lot to learn from this book about how to better to support the emotional needs of their growing young boys.  I certainly hope he writes more!"
Sue P,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read,"Update, since I've finished the book...Eye-opening, to say the least. Anyone who was a royal watcher during the Diana era (like I was), and witnessed what she went through regarding the invasive paparazzi and media, would find it hard to NOT believe what William, Harry, and now Meghan have had to endure.It will be interesting to see what, if anything, changes in the way The Firm and King Charles handles these challenges going forward."
Jeff C,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eye Opening Read,"This is worth the time and money to read. Prince Harry has shared his heart and his grief over losing his mother, and his vigilance to not not lose his wife in the same way. It’s sad, grief is cruel and awful on the norm but his experience was super-sized, multiplied, by the spectacle of his mothers death and having to share it with the world."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent,I believe this book. He has nothing to hide at this point. His writing is authentic without being pushy by trying to get the reader on his side. He writes plain and straightforward. As a therapist I tell parents to believe their kids unless they give you reason not to. How sad his father and brother did not come to his aid.
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and Sad,"I have felt sorry for Diana's boys since her death and especially watching them walk behind the coffin. I watched them grow up and always felt that Harry was the one most like her. Everyone expected William to be the one who would save the British Monarchy. I now feel that Harry and Meghan could have been William's greatest tool if/or when he becomes King. I think both boys were traumatized by their Mother's death, but only Harry finally sought help. It has been ""leaked"" years ago that William had serious anger issues and could go into rages. I now believe that is true as I hear real sincerity in Harry's account of his life and relationships. I also believe that both Charles and William are/were threatened by first Diana being more popular, then Harry and Meghan doing the same. Seems that strong, compassionate women threaten the ""Firm"". Britain's loss is the USA's gain. Harry's account was straightforward and heart wrenching. I spent all day reading the book as I couldn't put it down once I started. I applaud their motives and successes. I hope one day that the ""Firm"" wakes up and joins the modern world."
scn,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Great read!!,"I had pre-ordered this book when it first was announced, but then after reading a lot of junk from the British and American tabloids, I felt there was probably nothing of interest left to read.  Then I came back and read a few reviews.  They convinced me to give it a chance and boy, am I glad I did.I loved it.  It is beautifully written and definitely heartfelt.  Contrary to the newspapers, I didn't feel like he trashed his family any more than any of us do.  After reading this, I truly wish them the very best life has to offer."
Fox,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Honest and Impressive,"Throughout the book I thoroughly enjoyed Harry's detailed descriptions of all the historic residences, the furnishings, the people, their behaviors, the clothing, ...everything. He was so honest about everything. I'm so happy for him and Megan and their children. I'm so happy they're now in a good place. I was in tears while reading the last pages.  I highly recommend this book."
Darnel,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fearless,"A rare look into the personal world, mind, soul and life of an individual who happens to be a British Royal. ""Spare"" is intriguing, shocking, often humorous, heart breaking, but ultimately a personal triumph for a individual who dared to define himself, love who he wanted to love, and risked it all. Harry Windsor finds real love, independence, and personal happiness in the end despite some unresolved family issues that most of us have just not on a royal scale."
Maxine Barrera,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very insightful,I really enjoyed  reading this  book it tells the story of a young boy and his trials and triumphs  and ends with a man who despite all he and his family have suffered  just so they can have a peaceful  normal life that we all take for granted  you can still  overcome the hardships  with  love

Bre Stotts,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely not a spare,"This man lived so many lives in one lifetime. I'm sure being constantly compared and always the scapegoat was difficult especially when it is family doing it. I hope Harry has finally found the same kind of peace as he did in Botswana. Both him and Meghan deserve so much more and reading the tea and actually learning what goes on and how big certain egos can be really shows a whole new story. Although you were a ""spare"" in the line of succession, you definitely were a primary difference in this world."
Bryan C. Woolman,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb Autobiography,"Well written, easy to read.  Insightful and honest.  Another example showing the evil of the modern media. Even after reading this, it is still hard for this reader to actually believe that the monarchy is that full of itself.  Knowing what I know about yellow journalism and the pure evil of government in general helps. I wish all the best for Harry and Meghan and their children."
Frann Clarissa Bell,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare by Prince Harry,"Spare is a deeply personal account of Prince Harry's life thus far.  Born into privilege, his young life was marked by tragedy, sadness, restriction, abuse and an emotionally cold family, except for the love of Princess Diana. This book chronicles how he journeyed from the archetype of the ""spare"" into a stable, healthy, mature and happy individual, and who ultimately gained his freedom from the stranglehold of the royal family. I highly recommend."
A Lady,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Home Run and Then Some,"A very satisfying read.  As someone who has had their own journey through therapeutic healing, it is clear to me that Harry crafted his memoir with the highest standards of integrity, emotional honesty, and his truth.  I totally agree that his is an important voice in the historical record of his family.  No one has more right to voice the truth of their life as they have lived it, then the one who has actually lived it.  I believe his journey — so far — and his reliving it within these pages will help many struggling with their own PTSI, grief, or fear of facing the toxic in one’s life and saying, No More.  A remarkable man!"
sasha,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book!,"So happy for Prince Harry to have the courage to speak his story.  No one should have to be told to be quiet.

Savannah Wilson,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brutal Honesty; Harry gets to tell his side,"Harry shows that he is just like us, only that he isn’t. It really is a great response to the question “How could he air secret family details to the world?”  How could he not when his family did the same, only through the tabloids?  I appreciate that he was vulnerable in sharing embarrassing and sometimes “too much” facts that made me want to look away. However, I do feel that these vulnerabilities and stories are, in a way, relatable and may help others who are trying to cope with similar events in their lives."

S. Amis,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a journalist and have some of the same criticisms Prince Harry does,"Prince Harry has valid criticisms of the profession and media culture in general from a nearly unique perspective.Don't get me wrong: I passionately believe in freedom of the press, which is enshrined in the US Constitution for a reason. But that reason is speaking truth to power, not celebrity gossip or harassing children.I know people who walked away from jobs where they were expected to knock on the door of recently bereaved families and ""get the story"" no matter what. But the reward for that sense of restraint is unemployment.If you want the economics of that to change, stop feeding it. Read about what your government is up to and not the clickbait. And stop supporting anything Rupert Murdoch touches."

Mainly… that not all is what it seems, and especially while being part of the Royal Family."
Jacleen,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A sad story,"Many people have faulted Harry for writing this book. I feel sorry for him. He tells his story, and through it all you can hear him pleading for someone to care about what is on his heart. Poor guy has wanted to be heard and understood for most of his life. That’s also true for most people. We just don’t have to be onstage being critiqued 24/7."
ChiChi,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully written and a pleasure to read.,"Spare by Prince Harry came yesterday, and I finished it today. It was beautifully written and a pleasure to read. I had read some negative comments about the book on my computer news feed and after reading the book, I'm not sure the people who made the comments had read the book themselves. I'm afraid they may have based their opinions on hearsay. It was perhaps necessary to write Spare to clear the air. No one can hurt you like your own family, but I hope at some point the royal family will be able to reunite with all forgiven."
C Spears,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"The book is very engaging.  It addresses some things that had already been in the media as well as provides new enlightening information, giving the reader a feel for Harry's experiences behind-the-scenes. In reading the book I keep in mind it's Harry's perspective and his truth, as best as he could remember things.  It is a very good read."
Patricia Wass,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional look at Harry's life as a Royal,"This book was so heartwarming about Harry's life after Diana's death.  He did not speak poorly of his family, instead he provided his disappointment on how the Palace handled gossip spewed by the British media.  He also gave an insight on his relationship with William who he clearly loves unconditionally.  I have a new respect for both him and Meghan after reading this book."

The out of context ""quotes"" published in the tabloids before the books release made the book seem like drivel and it is anything but.

Biggles,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating and painfully honest,"This a very honest (sometimes way more than expected  - his ""todger""), no-holds bared look at life inside the tarnished cage of the British monarchy and how one family escaped. It starts off a bit slowly, but as it progresses, uou can't stop, even though you know the ending.  While Harry doesn't get a pass for a lot of his bad behavior, it's a lpt more understandable when put in context. I know it's not possible, but anyone else would have gone low to no- contact with the family. Knowing a lot more of his background, it's amazing he didn t take a darker path."

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Read,This book is a must read if you follow the royal family. None of us truly knows what goes on in anyone’s family but I feel that Harry is honest with his perspective. I’ve felt all along that he and his wife made the right decision for themselves by pulling away from his family and reading the details of the behind the scenes machinations justifies that choice to me. I think his mother would be more than proud of him for standing up for himself and his family and living the life that they want for themselves. Bravo.
jane webster,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the press say,"I am glad I bought this, and read it. It is much better than the snippets reported in the press. (Perhaps the same could be said of Harry.)Spare is beautifully written, and kept me interested in this story of a young man from a background so dissimilar from mine. There has been an extremely talented ghost writer, but much of the material from Harry is sensitive and thoughtful. He has a strong sense of place, and describes well the beauty of Africa and Frogmore. The most poignant part of the book, for me, is his journey through grief following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The secret hope he kept that she was not really dead, and that one day she would come back to surprise him, dressed in a wig and dark glasses. He believes, I think correctly, that he suffered post traumatic stress following her death. I suspect he was vulnerable to this because so much of his identity was, and is, founded on negatives. He was not the oldest. He was not the heir to the throne. William got things he did not. He does mention some positives about Charles, William and Kate, but the positives are greatly outweighed by the negatives he depicts, in detail. There are no positives at all in his portrait of Camilla.At times there is a lack of responsibility that worries me, one example being the Nazi uniform. He states that he was not taught about The Nazis at school. Really? At Eton? And he tells us that he phoned William and Kate from the shop, and they thought it was a hilarious idea. Harry describes William as jealous of him, and later on Megan. But he shows no insight whatsoever into his own jealousy of William.Harry believes that Charles and Camilla have leaked details of both his and William’s private lives to the press in an effort to improve their own public image. His evidence for this is that Charles was the only person told about the details reported. He can not see the irony that for the last three years he and Megan have been doing exactly the same thing.Harry describes Megan as “born to be a princess.” As with his mother, he sees no negatives in her whatsoever. He acknowledges that his father and brother do not like her, but attributes this to them succumbing to the negative image of her portrayed by the press.  I am uncomfortable with this, but understand his anger that the Royal Family have never challenged the hateful comments made about her.There can be a naivety about Harry at times.  How naïve is it to think he can carry our royal duties in Britain while residing in California? And that residing in California will ensure his children are not harassed by the press?Yes, there are holes in the story but it is a beautifully written account of a dysfunctional, unhappy family, well worth reading."

C. Bailey,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, Emotional and Unexpected","I think the first chapter did an excellent job of introducing the point of this book. Prince Harry, frustrated and feeling misunderstood, wants the world to know who he is. Isn't that the point of an autobiography? After finishing the book I feel like I have a better picture of why Prince Harry has struggled for so many years. I find it sad that his family would rather continue the unhealthy relationships they have with the media instead of demanding better. I'm glad to see that he and Meghan have rejected the toxicity of that parasitic environment and are instead choosing to live with integrity."
Angel,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible !! Without Words!!,"I lived every moment, Prince Harry described and narrated about his life.  I felt every feeling, every emotion! I’m so proud of him to have the strength to share his story. Best wishes to him, his wife and kids, health and peace always! You all well deserve it! I Recommend it 100%. Read it, you won’t regret it!"
Vikster77,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Harry’s touching, entertaining memoir reigns supreme","What an impressive memoir. Poignant, honest, heart-breaking, exciting, funny. Terrifying to read about the details of the bullying by the British press. I felt that he was very fair in reporting the details of their persecution by the press and their lack of support from the Firm. So happy that this very impressive young man has found true love and a new home in the U.S. Welcome home, Harry."
Jessica,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful, brave book","This is a gorgeous, vulnerable, searing memoir. Bravo to Harry (and to his ghostwriter) for producing a book that so helpfully plumbs trauma, grief, and its aftermath in such an open and accessible way.  Harry has helped a lot of people with this book, including me.  So happy that he's living a better life and is well-loved."
Teri E. Johnson,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wasn’t disappointed!,"I waited anxiously for this book to be published, and it certainly didn’t disappoint. Harry and Megan come across as real people, with feelings and hopes…I am glad they escaped the Royal Family and British press, and I hope they continue to thrive.The Royals need great big mirrors in every space they inhabit, so they can see who the villains of the story are, lol."
SG,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magnificent,"This book is so magnificent I read it in one 14 hour sitting. I couldn’t put it down until it was finished.It’s so well written and so wise and deep. I felt it would be a healing balm for those of us who have experienced trauma and death and it was also so much more. It is remarkable the strength and insight and goodness that shine through after everything Harry has been through.And yes, I agree it is Rupert Murdock and his gang of evil thugs that rule Britain. Not the King or the Queen. Also the toxic evil courtiers spreading hate and lie and destruction. This book is a strong ray of light against all of that. Much more powerful than I imagined it could be. It strengthened me to read it."
Brittany ,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worthy Read,"Hearing his story in his own words was worth the read. Beautifully told, funny, and heartbreaking. Came away with a new respect for Prince Harry. I didn’t find this book to be damaging to the Monarchy, as they are doing just fine damaging themselves. If the Murdoch media is where the British public obtain most of their “news,” it’s a bad look for you all."
Carolyn Strong,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Enlightening, yet sad","I confess to being intrigued by the Royal Family over the years. The British tabloids have troubled me with their outsized role in judging Harry and Meghan. This memoir is revealing and genuinely honest in sharing what it was like to be targeted by the media and receive no support from Harry's own family. Grief, sibling rivalry, institutional norms and the need for autonomy are all key to this memoir. I understand now why Harry and Meghan made the decisions that are detailed in these pages. My heart goes out to them."
Lynn Black,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking,This makes me so sad. The fact that his family doesn't get it or more accurately is in complete denial is absolutely heartbreaking.  I am so thankful this man had the wherewithal to get his family to safety. I wish someone had been there for Diana when she was going through similar turmoil. Shame on the British press and shame on the royal family.
kimberly mihalik,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Class Act,"Prince Harry’s honest and first hand account of his life is honest, touching, heartbreaking, and joyful. One needs not be royal to identify with life’s most profound moments and family discord.His story is about love: the honest love given from a mum taken too soon and the love he fights to protect today.Well done."
Aleksandar Genov,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well written,"I think Moehringer and Harry have done a really good job with structuring the book, I think it is a well-written piece of biographical work on very recent events. This is of course the account of one side but I nevertheless found it really engaging and thought-provoking to learn more about the experience of being born, raised and effectively pushed out of the royal family. I also thought that Harry handles his account with a good amount of respect for his family despite how he and his wife were treated by the palace, which I personally appreciated."
dawn,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A side of things never seen before,"It captivated my attention from start to finish. Aside from what’s been told before, Harry shares his life and what it was like in words he was never allowed to speak. He exposed that the real power of England is held by the tabloids not the monarchy. It’s heart breaking and beautiful at the same time. Highly recommend reading this!"
Nancy Moore,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, honest, sad…","This is a very clear picture of Harry. He tells of his grief, confusion, passions — it’s a “coming of age” story. He speaks in a voice that’s humorous at times and heartbreaking at others. This young man is a shining example of what, I’m sure his Mother wanted him to become. Much respect to you, Sir. I highly recommend this book."
Rose,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written, almost lyrical","It is a beautifully written story. Poignant & lyrical in its delivery. If you purchase expecting a book full of sensational drama or shock and awe tell-all, you’ll be highly disappointed. Prince Harry lays it all bare. You can’t help but to sympathize with him. Your emotions will run the gamut - there will be anger and pity on his behalf. You will cry. You will laugh. Totally a worthy read."

KC,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best authentic Book Ever. A masterpiece,"Best authentic Book Ever. A masterpiece that leaves you spell bound, enthralled and gasping for more. This is what I call LOVE, a brave Prince who defied all odds to be with his love against a manipulative horrible family that refuses to change and be  diverse.  King Charles is a sorry excuse of a dad and his mistress Camilla is a terrible Step mother. I recommend this book and give it a 6 star. He writes beautifully"
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Warrior,"I recommend Harry's book to anyone who battles PTSD, family issues, loss of loved ones. Dysfunction and death visit every house, from palace to grass hut. I love this book for it's honesty and heart. Hearing Harry tell of his and Meghan's falling in love and the love of their children. Harry, you have always been my favorite!"
Barbiesue,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well Done Prince Harry,"So, I finished this book…WOW!Extremely well written, surprising revelations, gut wrenching at times, and simply outstanding. His conflict was unsolvable and his anguish and desperation palpable. Well done Prince Harry. I’m sure there was so much more you could have disclosed and because you did not, your character and integrity shine through. As a mom myself, I am sure yours would be quite proud."
AC,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much better than I expected,I thought this was going to be a whiny snooze fest. I wasn’t a big Harry fan until now. People really need to look themselves in the mirror if they don’t find empathy for this man. I can admit that I was wrong with my initial assessment of Harry. I ask you to open up your mind and heart prior to reading this book.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truth and Goodness,This book enthralled me. The human spirit within the pages leaps into your soul and cries out to be heard. The love and respect that he has for family is not extinguished by his sense of betrayal and hurt. Both are there and exist separately from the other. That is how you know that this is a work of truth.
P Mehta,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cathartic,"Having lived through Harry and Meghan’s traumatic experiences the past 6 years and having identified with the pain of adult sibling rivalry and toxic family members that are only to happy to label people getting the help they need as “crazy” or “thick” or “addicts” , I am so grateful for this book to find a virtual kinship to the pain of trauma and family abuse. It is cathartic."
Fannie,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you Harry!,"This story is heart wrenching, shocking, exciting, sweet, loving...and most of all...the truth of him and his life.

The truth will set you free.,"A rare peek at the inner workings of the Royal family and their tangled and toxic association with the press.Living through the blatant lies, misrepresented statements and harassment by the press was hard to image.Prince Harry exhibited remarkable courage to break Royal traditions to save his wife and his children.Prince Harry tells his truth and he has written an excellent book that I highly recommended."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry's memories of growing up Royalty,"Excellent book. Harry did not trash his family. He narrated his life, growing up Royal from his memories. The good, bad and ugly. One could feel the love he has for family. There is no such thing as a  perfect family. However; It's unfortunate, the firm's loyalty to the tabloids/news columns came before the loyalty of his family.Good job Harry! You made it to the otherside!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Food for thought,"I wanted to read this, I hoped to get around to it eventually, then I saw all the stuff published prior to it's release and decided not to wait. I feel sorry for the Royal family, born into a puppet show and having to spend their whole lives performing like puppets. Harry's refusal is commendable, no doubt motivated by the anger born from the brutal passing of his mother. Terribly sad. How anyone can speak ill of this individual, I do not know. I will be working towards ensuring I do not click on anymore of these ridiculous stories in newspapers, anymore. The contribution towards their income is contributing towards absolute misery for many, no doubt. Worse, untimely deaths."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Authentic, well written/compelling","Enjoyable, heartbreaking at times, well written account. Trauma packs the pages but there is also much positivity too. I sincerely hope the book brings about peace to Harry, being silenced can trap people within their trauma, hopefully this book will bring about much healing for him. It was truly fascinating to hear his story. A brave act which simply outlines the reality of family life in extreme, extraordinary circumstances of royal life. It was fascinating to compare the British Press headlines with the reality of the book, it well illustrated the very issues that Harry was describing in the book. Things were twisted. I will certainly be reading any news paper more critically from now on. Congratulations to Harry, this is a fantastic book."
addictedtoreading,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rings True,A fascinating look at the inner workings of being a royal. Always saw the Windsors as a mess but the depth of in fighting and beyond ridiculous protocol amazed me. I wish Harry and Megan peace and justice and continued deep love. I believe both are astoundingly brave and dedicated individuals who fight to protect the good in this messed up world of ours.
William O. Bank,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grief and the Spirit of Invictus,"A surprising Thread of Grief runs through this recounting of Harry's life, sometimes gossamer, sometimes as thick and heavy as a hawser, but always inspiring. I found it heaviest in his flight training and during his therapy sessions. Others will find it elsewhere. Grief lasts forever but evolves like a sunrise, always changing but always effecting the lives of the living. Thank you for writing this book."
Jo Bridle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A New perspective,"It's refreshing and interesting to read his side of things. It has changed my opinion on a great deal of topics. It must be a relief to finally call out certain misgivings and untruths.I'm not sure how far this book goes to build bridges with Willy and Pa but then again, maybe this is his way of saying he's better off out of it all."
Hilary Davoudi,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An absolute must read!,"This book completely answered all of my questions I’ve ever had about Harry’s life. It is heartfelt, one minute it will have you laughing the next in absolute gut wrenching tears. This is well written, it always stays on track of the story that’s being displayed and the time line is picturesque! His words are at times uplifting, and others shattering. He points out the good and bad in the people in his family with respect and not hatred. He looks back at the most painful and rewarding times of his life, his mentors etc. I can’t say enough good things about this book. I waited so long to read exactly this! Well done Haz. Well done."
BcSmith,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Genuine,"This was one of the most genuine books I’ve read thus far. Autobiographies can hit different for many. This one reveals moments that had all the receipts. It’s funny, sad, gripping, filled with raw honesty, and memorable. It showed the bonds of love, the spirit of a man to endure unnatural obstacles and continue to push for honesty and truth, and how important it is ton fight for what one believes in."
amie jefferson,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it,"Although there was very little information in this book that we did not already know, it is a whole other experience to read an accounting of events in his own words. This book is also very well written and very readable. Even for someone who may not be a royal watcher, it is an interesting book about a very unique life."
Gayle Stream,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,I found the autobiography to be very moving. Everyone sees life through the eyes of their own experiences. Harry has truly gone from a boy to a man... I can only hope that is future is great with His bride and his children. It was his story to tell not anybody else's. That will never change he told it his way. God bless.
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life is a battle,I read this book more slowly than my usual pace.I felt the  words were very sincere.  Prince Harry was not an ordinary child and was subjected to human frailties he didn't know how to cope with.He searched for guidance but found difficulty in obtaining it.Hopefully he can make peace with the Royal family and maintain a life for Megan and children.
Alexa Weeks,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great read, raises important questions","Whether or not you believe this account, it certainly helps raise questions on media accountability and our own personal accountability to each other. If you find yourself only scrutinizing this account, and nothing else put out with “palace sources” cited, you may need to take a hard look at how you consume and judge information and motive."
Cynthia,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Highly personal account,"The writing is okay, not stellar, but I made it through.  This is a bunch of screwed up folks--at least Harry has the guts to admit it.  If what he says about the rest of the family is not true, I'd be issuing some denials, if I were them.  If true, Harry and Meghan had no choice but to leave in my view.  Where do we get the idea that there should be a group of people revered and lavishly supported just for being born?"
Jeff Pan,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Engaging Read; Don’t Hestitate to Order,"“Spare” allows you to experience and understand Harry’s life through tragedy, conflict, bravery, sadness, love and recovery. Intelligently written and full of detail that allows you to exoerience his account of growing up royal…from castles to African safaris to the challenge of maintaining sanity amidst limited privacy and media savages. Can’t wait for volume 2; the next 400 pages!"
Janet Koeller,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written with proficiency, honesty and bravery.","The Royal Family are human and have  had to deal with many difficulties over the years,  some of which were their own doing and some not. I think the press should be held more accountable than they are. There should be laws in place that can still protect freedom of speech but not jeopardise the rights of the people being perpetrated."
Christine Betz,Reviewed in Germany on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tolle Biografie,"Das Buch ist sehr schön geschrieben.

And they most certainly did not deserve that. This book is compelling, eye opening and made me want to reach out and hug them both. People can be so mean, especially family because they think we won't remove them from our lives. So, if you ask me, Meghan and Harry made the right choice for their little family."

Rather than use that to the RF’s credit, they sought to bury Meghan. That’s it in a nutshell, folks."

No page left unturned 😆 People associate royal family with opulence, wealth, joy, privilege, the best life ever, like they are demigods or something. It's proven once again: Never judge a book by its cover!!! 😝 Harry has my support for walking away from that toxic life. All the best, Harry ❤️"
Mardie,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Truly, exceptionally inspiring","It feels like a journey, reading as if the words spoke into the mind. He is genuine, so completely bare as he lays down his life, his flaws, passions and achievements. It’s impossible to not feel human while diving into his memoir and to not somehow feel “seen”. It’s something everyone should seek to experience on their own."
Darlene E. Lerum,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read.,This book gives a very interesting perspective to the life of the monarchy.  The Paparazzi in this Country are disgusting but they seem to be even worse in England and almost approved of by the Crown.  So much pain for the Prince.

What a fabulous, well written book and a breath of fresh air to hear this story from the horse’s mouth. I could not put it down, remembering so many times I was glued to the TV—Dianna’s wedding, William’s and Harry’s births and marriages, Dianna’s, Phillip’s and the Queen’s funerals and all the news stories in between. I could almost hear Paul Harvey saying “stay tuned for the rest of the story.” And the rest of the story finally makes sense. I hope some day they feel like there is a place for them in the UK, but in the meantime, we’re proud to call you Americans."
Earthling,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasure To Read.,"From the moment I picked up the book and started reading, I didn't want to put it down. It grabs your interest. It's well-written, funny and brilliant in parts, sad and heartwrenching in others. For the past several years the tabloids have been mostly cruel, even sadistic in their treatment of Harry and and Meghan. So it was refreshing to read about Harry, his life, his thoughts in his own words, not the dysfuntional tabloids' fabrications."
Barbikat,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Truth Shall Set You Free!,"An awkward beginning but as the story unfolded, I was spellbound!  What an amazing memoir!  Prince Harry has an emotional and provocative life and I'm grateful he has shared this with the world.  I haven't enjoyed reading a book so much.  I've learned so much about being royal, war and most importantly, love!"
Maria Gauthier,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile read,"A lot of people assume this is a book written to bash the Royal Family. That is not true.

Nice to hear his side without that fear mongering British press. What the Royals/press subjected him and his wife to is horrifying and not out of line with what the 'Royals' have done for centuries.  I hope they can have some peace here in the States.  Kind of sanitized the issues and cut out most of the British dialogue which was disappointing; hence the 4 stars."
Jess,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t put the book down.,"Spare is so beautifully and tenderly written. He’s not out for blood. All the “scathing take downs” of the Royal Family makes sense once you read the quotes in context. You can sense that Harry is honest, loves his family but they clearly did him wrong. And the British tabloids are pure, evil trash."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good read,"Firstly I feel it very important from a historical context to have primary sources such as this memoir. Secondly I feel that if you have ever had to deconstruct and break generational trauma this is a helpful read, in that it can make you feel less alone and more seen. I mean if a prince can do it then you certainly are not alone."
Jan,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glaring,"I know the so-called ""royal family"" has read it and will comfort themselves with self-lies about the actual circumstances and events. But even the casual onlooker can see the emotional neglect and deliberate intent to control, or, failing that, destroy a young family who posed a threat to other members' limelight. Nasty business, ugly legacy for a justly dying, hypocritical institution."
Ju,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful read,"I could not put this book down. Well-written. Harry’s voice really shines through. Compelling. Honest. Vulnerable. Heartbreaking. Funny. This is truly a book about Harry’s life, not a hit piece against his family. He has no malice for them, but he does not shy away from expressing his feelings towards their actions and inactions. At the core, there is always love."
patricia griner,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very moving, finally understanding","It is so sad reading how alone he was in his family. I understand the royal families lack of warmth, as that's how they were all raised. Thanks to Diana the boys had a different experience for a few short years. But I can't understand how the family could just abandon him. I wish him well and happiness, sadly he's better off without them in his life."
Sojourner,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written, powerful, honest","Love this book. The press, as they will do, pulled tiny bits out of context and squeezed what juicy suggestiveness the could out of them. But in context, there is nothing vicious here, just an incredibly interesting, courageously honest story. Thank God Harry and Meghan chose sanity over toxic compliance, and got out. They are doing such good work in this world."

Yes, you might find a few things to nitpick, but overall it is a remarkable journey this man has gone through. Kudos to Harry for seeking mental health therapy even when past attempts didn’t work.

I’d read very negative comments about it with the media, in fact, a few close friends and relatives had also referred to it as gingers book!!Having just finished reading it and it certainly deserved the 5 stars I’ve given.  It was very well written, so honest and humbling and I felt everything I read was certainly a true version of the events.Well done for speaking out and giving us an insight to this emotional rollercoaster journey that’s been blighted by childhood tragedy badly handled by adults.

Keith Magee,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Truth, itself, is always entirely subjective","In Spare, Prince Harry has shared his personal accounts of pain and trauma, with bits of humour and descriptions of cherished memories along the way. The book is well written and draws you into each instance as though you're watching a posh soap opera. However, Harry divulges so many intimate details, I’m left pondering how this whole endeavour can bring healing for him or build a bridge to 'unite' his family or indeed the kingdom. I simply can’t help but wonder how Harry’s family will be able to trust him after all these ‘revelations’? Perhaps, I'm such a protector of family and privacy that I would never go so public with our frailties but instead would work to find ways to heal from a quiet and helpful place. And, yet, I clearly get that Harry feels his considerable pain was brushed aside by a family well versed in the art of 'getting on with it' and protecting the Crown.If Spare led us to understand how to turn pain into power; explored how to address unconscious bias as a way to expose racism; gave us lessons learned on how the monarchy, the British press, we all, could be better, then I could totally see the point of it. Sadly, the book does none of those things – it's like tattle tailing without offering solutions. The Sussexes’ continued rhetoric has centred on their understandably deeply held fear and resentment of the British tabloid press and, yet, the Duke has now delivered mounds of information to fuel that fire and further exacerbate the newspapers’ indignation.As a cleric, I paused to pray that Harry will find peace and reconciliation. I even pray that the royal family will find a way address its problems without the with the entire world seeing its undergarments on display. As a son, brother, and cousin, I'd be outraged by the much of the content of Spare. As a resident of the U.K., my heart goes out to HM The King, The Prince of Wales, and all the members of the royal family, who must now grapple with whether to stand or remain in silence in their truths. Whatever that really means, for in circumstances such as these, truth, itself, is always entirely subjective."
Janna A,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Poignant, refreshingly honest.","My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. I hope they move forward with grace and never look back. They deserve so much better than what they experienced. One day the truth will be known and those who skulked and gaslighted will have regrets. H & M can hold their heads high. Best to them. Raspberries to the family who stood by, silently... or worse, plotting."
David Gilmore,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Needed to be said….,"Regardless of one‘s position on the lives of the royal family, it seems to me that all sides need an opportunity to voice their respective positions on their personal experiences.  This memoir is a part of that process and is worthy of the time it takes to read and absorb what has gone on since 31 August 1997."
Anne,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A worthwhile read,"The book was so much better than I expected.  Thoroughly engrossing in places (the Army service particularly), touching, and eye-opening, particularly with respect to the corruption of the British tabloids, who are abetted by self-interested members of the author's family.  Prince Harry has a big heart, and that comes through admirably.  Sure, there is irony in spilling intimate family details while decrying the British press for pursuing the same at all costs; but this is ultimately a personal story."
jkirth,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is about a man who needs to process his trauma,"Every family no matter the status has difficulties, I hope and pray that Harry finds the peace he deserves.  I hope him family reads the book and understands the pain that he tried to work through himself and the unconditional love he sought from his family and found with Mehgan.  Good luck Harry you deserve goodness in your life."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful eye opening book,"I loved this book. I watched when Diana carried Harry out of the hospital. I do not understand the Royal Family. All Harry asked for was permission to leave and pursue a happy life. Why are they so hateful and cruel. What's the big deal if he leaves. He is a human being, a child of God. Leave him alone to find his own way. Taking away his military medals is the icing on the cake. They have no power to take those away. He earned them. How dare they do such a thing Harry you and your wife and beautiful children go on to have a happy life. That is the best revenge.Welcome to the United States."
Louie,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Personal impressions,"I was impressed at how Prince Harry could express his heartfelt desire to protect others, including persons and animals and of course Meg and his kids.  In the past I have enjoyed reading historical fiction with the setting in the Highlands so his description of the landscape and castles were so real-life."
DBaur,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly Recommend,"This is an emotional read. I have always been against monarchies (all monarchies) including the one in the UK. This memoir shows many of the problems inherit in them, the selfishness and belief in genetic superiority that harms even the people caught up in it. It certainly harmed Harry Windsor and his wife. I applaud that they had the strength to escape."
Volunteer Reviewer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good easy read,Book is an easy read with short chapters. I like shorter chapters so I can read in short spurts.  Finished the book within 24 hours of receiving so it kept me interested.  Enjoyed the read as I found the writing style approachable.Interesting insights into his life.I won’t give an opinion on the content as each reader should draw his/her own conclusions.  Also I normally don’t read biographies and/or autobiographies so I have no frame of reference.
Maria,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,great book!,"I wasn’t sure what to expect reading this book, but Prince Harry was so open about some of the toughest experiences of his life. He shared personal information and did it in a way that still protected others. He’s very well written and genuine. Great read. I think the greatest disappointment was seeing the true character of his brother that has been shielded by the media."
K. Childs,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,HMMMM....,"Having always been a Harry fan, I found the book very interesting.  And since I lived in the UK & worked with Brits for a few years, I had some familiarity with the areas, the celebrations, the press, & the monarchy.  The book was well-written & very readable, tho a little long-winded on his Army days.  I didn't give it a full 5-stars because there's always 2 sides to every story.  I'd like to hear the other side, but we never will."

Posarama,Reviewed in Germany on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"a Great read about love, family and values","A love one feels for their family does not have to be returned. Often children born into abusive families show love towards their abusers. I see this no different. I do hope Harry and Meghan reunite with their extended families but if it doesn’t happen, it ain’t their loss."
Mrs.Nyc,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"Harry has managed to write about the most vulnerable parts of his life with raw honesty and delightful moments of humor.

Learned a lot of new things. Got an eye view into a world I’d never know about. I don’t think the book is that controversial or at least until the last third of it. I hope the family is able to reconcile one day
NC Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Riveting, brutally honest, emotional page turner","Harry shared the truth with the world.  I know it was difficult but he needed to tell the truth, to set the record straight.  The royal family abandoned him and the British press sought to destroy him and his family. He set the record straight.  He opened his heart and told the raw painful truth of what he and Meghan endured."

I also think Prince Harry could have a new career narrating books. What a voice!"
Angie,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An incredible story about loss, love... and one seriously dysfunctional family","During my daily commute to work, I always stop by the local newsagent, where the papers are displayed for all to see. In the years following Harry and Meghan’s wedding, the constant barrage of vicious headlines denigrating the Royal Family’s newest member was, quite frankly, appalling. I couldn’t understand why the royals weren’t standing up for her, especially when she was pregnant. In the end, I concluded they were cowards.Spare not only reinforced everything I suspected, it also painted a picture of a dysfunctional family whose members are so out of touch with the average Brit they have no business acting as our representatives on the world stage. What struck me most was the petty, puerile jealousy of the males, specifically William and Charles. The former comes across as a spoiled brat who throws his silver spoon out of the pram whenever he doesn’t get what he wants. Charles gets off a little bit lighter. You get the sense that he loves his son, but his fears about being eclipsed by other members of the family ultimately paint him as a pathetic, insecure man more interested in lifting himself up than others. Not a quality you hope to see in any public servant, let alone a king. As for the women, I actually groaned aloud during the retelling of the ‘baby-brain’ incident. All this time, I’ve been decrying the stereotype that we Brits walk around with sticks permanently rammed up our arses. Clearly, some of us do. Thanks for that, Kate. You’re doing the UK populace a real service. Finally, Camilla. I used to feel sorry for her. She was vilified for loving a man. Her failure to comment on the opinion piece Clarkson wrote about Meghan shortly after he dined with the Queen Consort left a bitter taste. I thought she was a treacherous wench then. After reading Spare, I’m convinced of it.What’s truly sad is that all of this could have been prevented if the Royal Family had just shown some balls and challenged the press instead of feeding them. Hopefully, instead of blaming others, they’ll start looking inwards. Harry hasn’t created their latest PR problem. They have. Many of us were starting to develop negative impressions of them long before the Oprah interview, and I say this as someone who used to have a lot of respect for the royals. I can’t say I support the monarchy itself, but I appreciated the causes the RF were trying to shine a light on. Now it all seems like a joke. After watching the drama unfold in real-time, and especially after reading Spare, the claims that they care about mental health and ending violence against women sound utterly hollow. No doubt they’ll double down on the ‘Meghan Markle is a witch’ narrative, but I honestly think it’s a losing strategy, especially amongst younger demographics.On a positive note, Spare is an inspirational memoir that, at times, moved me to tears. It contains themes that will resonate with most readers, including surviving loss, overcoming grief, self-discovery and finding love - not just the romantic kind, but that which can be forged between friends and brothers in arms. At times, it was funny. Even in the chapters detailing the harrowing training Harry underwent to prepare him for what he might face if kidnapped in a war zone, there were lighter moments.In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My favourite line, perhaps the one that touched me most of all, came towards the end and will stick with me for quite some time.My Love. She said: That is not a Spare."

ECRB,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t put it down,Enjoyed this book more than I was expecting. It was a raw account of trauma and the cycle that happens when trauma is not addressed. It was very interesting insight into the inner workings of the royal family and honestly quite sad. And we thought our families were dysfunctional! Glad Harry got out and is speaking his truth.
Bri,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Riveting, could not put it down","I inhaled this book in a day.  After all the leaks about the 'salacious details' leading up to the book release, it was fascinating to read the actual context behind these stories.  The comparison of the leaks with what the book actually says drives home the overarching theme of the book, which is the impact of the dishonesty of the 24 hour news cycle which severely impacts the mental health and well being of royals, who also happen to be human.  Prince Harry shares his life story unapologetically and honestly.  He doesn't sugar coat stories about the mistakes he has made, which makes the story feel all the more authentic.  His description of his family members also feels authentic and portrays the reality of the parasitic relationship between the royal family and the media.  Take the time to read the book, don't believe all the negative headlines."

He is a good person and I hope he can be at peace and not listen to all the evil/negative chatter that continually surrounds him. I do not think it is a book of bomb shells at all. The tragic passing of his precious mother has had tremendous repurcussions throughout his life.  The book makes this evident. It reads more as an autobiography then a rant on his family.

I wanted to see what he had to say for himself. I cant help but feel for him. Yes he was born into privilege, he's hardly to blame for that. But it's clear its not the life he wanted for himself, way before Meghan. My heart goes out to him to be honest. They may have more money than most yes, but what is money when all a child wants is a hug from his father and grandmother? Money wont bring his mother back. Maybe he is doing things the wrong way, but we aren't all perfect are we?"

Jason,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,you go Harry,I found this book to be very honest. I understand the family fearing the loss of the monarchy. They should have helped Harry and his family and protected.them. They should still provide security for his family. He was born into a fish bowl he earned protection for his family.
Sara Paglio,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real picture of growing up Royal,We’ll written memoir from Harry’s point of view about growing up in the Royal family after his mothers death. He’s honest about his mistakes and shows growth as a person. So proud of him for what he’s overcome and the good he’s doing to try help others. Excellent and touching read
Desiree D. Barnett,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A moving life story,"What a good autobiography. Harry shows genuine love and compassion for his family but he’s also unflinching in HIS assessment of those family members. His ire is squarely directed at the poisonous UK media and its effect on the family. Mostly though, this is a book about life, death, personal growth, love and spiritual connections. Loved it. Highly recommend!"

Be happy and remember always American people luv Meg and we luv U.I thank you for putting into words the hardship and trauma of being Princess Diana Son."
Amanda,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A sad, witty, and soulful read!","Excellent book!  As it happens, Harry is much smarter than the tabloids led us to believe.  This book made me laugh, cry, and rage. I love the subtle invitations to challenge his allegations (there is a 25 page document that counters the “Meaghan is a bully” story, he “kept the texts”, there is camera on the Apache that records all kills)."
Joann,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book,"I liked Prince Harry’s honesty and I believe everything he said - I can only imagine how much Harry felt he could not publish. Harry was not my favorite royal before this, but he is now. God bless him and his wife and children. I hope they all flourish and thrive safely here in America."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wonderful story from the bravest of princes,"It takes a great deal of courage to overcome trauma, to deal with your pain and break free from family dysfunction.  Harry is sharing his journey of doing just that.  This book is so much more than the snippets in tabloids, it’s a story of learning to find, and love himself.  Something each of us who have suffered childhood trauma and grief can fully understand.  This book paints so much more than family drama, if gives tidbits of history, of war and the price one pays for forging their own path."
Rani Bauer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy read, interesting, and well written.",I enjoyed this. It was an easy read and he gives good details that help the reader visualize the setting of his story.  And goodness his life is so unique… being born into a family that you can’t escape from without severe global backlash… it stressed me out a bit reading it!
chiavet,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this book,Enjoyed reading the Spare.  Found it to be very easy to read.  Growing up in the environment of the Royal family. Recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what actually happened throughout Harry's life and not the garbage put out by the British press.
susan,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written, heartbreaking story.","This book was a wonderful insight into Harry 's life and his search for meaning. I think I cried through the first seven chapters, reading about how Diana's death affected him over the course of his life. I hope writing this has helped to heal his wounds. He's always been my favorite Royal, now he's just one of my favorite people."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare - Prince Harry,"What a wonderful story in Prince Harry's own words.  If even a fraction of his story is accurate, and I believe it is, the British Press is deplorable and disgraceful.  I have read and watched many documentaries on Royal Protocol's.  Being a Royal is no picnic.God Bless Harry, Megan, and their children.  Wonderful Read."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding Book!!!!,"Such an inciteful and heartwarming book written by Harry.  He told his story his way!!  Well done Harry, well done.  A story of internal pain, heartache and loneliness!!!  May your book bring you peace, joy and most of all the happiness you so richly deserve!!!"
LeeAnn Boggs,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it!,I'm so glad Harry was finally able to tell his truth. It was eye opening and very emotional. I cannot believe all that he had to endure. He and Meghan seem very happy and I'm glad that he finally seems at peace and he can live his life. I wish him and his family peace and happiness.
Stet,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Something's Missing,"I enjoyed the first two-thirds of Harry's autobiography.  Royals are just  like you and me (with added security, access to better drugs and  stamina for partying that I can only envy).  I celebrated his long and arduous training with the British military and his success in uniform.  I believe him to be a truly empathetic and kind person, and believe his vigorous support for environmental causes -- particularly in his beloved Africa -- are at his core as a human.His meeting and love affair with Meghan are glorious set pieces -- and the challenges they faced as a couple are easily understandable. His hatred of the British press is palpable. And his contempt for the royal press employees is clearly deserved.What's missing in the final pages of the book -- which focus on the clashes he had with his brother and father -- are any sense of their side of the story.  There is no clear explanation of why his brother would assault him other than he has chosen the institution of the crown over family. There is no clear explanation why -- in the presence of extraordinary threats to his family -- that the crown would remove all his security.I believe Harry and Meghan were done a terrible disservice by the British royal press machine, and their is no excuse for the extraordinary racism they rained down upon her.  But I ended the book wanting to know his brother and father's take on things...from their own lips.In short, the ending, for me, was a bit too facile, too polished. Family conflicts are always messy, complicated and overwrought clashes. I came away thinking this one was too neatly stacked, tied up and put away.It left me thinking --in the end -- that sometimes a good ghost writer is too good for the subject at hand."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A beautiful memoir!,"This is a wonderful, honest,spiritual, and riveting account of an amazing young man. It deserves six stars. I highly recommend this for any skeptics about Harry and Meg. They are the real deal and I applaud them for leaving that repressive and sick family called The Institution. Glad to have you here in California!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read,No matter what you feel about Harry this book is in his words and his feelings about his life thus far.  He truly is his mother’s son and wants to find his way in life his way.  I need to get the audio and listen it in his own words.
Lily,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An eye opener,I got this book delivered on Saturday January 14 and I did nothing all weekend but read it and I must say it was worth my time! An Eye Opener! All That Gliters Is Not DIAMOND. People should love the life they have and live it to the fullest!
AA,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Behind the Palace Wall,"Harry was thrown under the base at an early age in school by the ""firm"". Charles historically was jealous of Diana getting the attention. Now jealous of HARRY and Megan. It's shows how cold the family is towards Harry and Megan. The palace will never respond to Spare. Thanx Harry for the truth !!"
Laurie Mitchell,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thoughtful read,"Whatever you may feel about the British monarchy, this book is a very thoughtful read. Prince Harry owns up to his flaws and mistakes. He delves into his mental health issues without holding back. When we hear of a child losing a parent, we don’t realize the far-reaching effect on their whole life choices. Especially losing a loving caring parent."
Jason L,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent story of truth,"Only half way through, and Harry tells the truths of his life.  It’s sad to me, but it gives you a look inside to what he was dealing with in his life.  He made such a brave decision to leave and start a new life for his wife and kids."
Florence Igbinovia,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant! Very well written, clear and simple to understand.","Loved how detailed and to the point the issues were explained. I will recommend ""Spare"" to others to read. Most of all it was refreshing to finally hear from Prince Harry, his own story after all these years. May Almighty God continue to protect, guide and bless him, his wife and children and also his mother-in-law. Amen."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and heartwarming,"This book was so full of emotions. Even from a young age you felt for Harry being made to endure the British media. You can feel the love he has for his mother and can understand his heartache and anger. He has been totally honest about all his wrongs and owns up to his mistakes. He still has a lot of love for his family, just not the institution that runs it. He may be royalty but he's still human, like everyone else he just needs love and affection. Good luck to him, Meghan and their kids. They deserve every happiness. Genuine and honest biography."
Jacs,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Candid, eloquent and engrossing!","Absolutely loved this book. We finally get to understand things more clearly. Harry takes you on a journey from his early years, the impact the loss of his mother had on him and insightful explanations of how he tried to process such a tragedy.Moving through his time at Eton to where he is now, I did not want it to end.The book is not rammed to the rafters with salacious gossip, it is not scandalous, it is a very open and honest account of his life. There are revelations which surprised me, but the story is remarkable, you feel as if you are reading something very intimate and private.I have to say that while opinions will always be divided, I am quite sure people who are angry at Harry would read the book and still give it a scathing review because that is what they planned to do before they even read the first page, but for people who are not taking sides, and understand that as mere outsiders looking in we cannot possibly know what really went on, then it is an eye opener.The press, as we know, have a lot to answer for and it is clear that Harry has an axe to grind. Why wouldn't he? They hounded his mother to her death and have learned nothing since. No one holds them to account and they can print what they like.I think no less of Charles or William, or the monarchy in its entirety, for reading this book, but what it did do was reinforce my long standing view that Harry is entirely misunderstood and that his family should take a large proportion of responsibility for this sad and sorry state of affairs.Thank you to Harry for giving us his side and for speaking out. He is his mothers son and that is something which cannot be disputed, twisted, lied about or covered up!"
Michelle Henderson,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,team Harry and Meghan,"I have always believed that Meghan and Harry were perfect together. I have always believed the tabloid press is criminal, and to blame for his mother’s death. This beautiful book, in his own words, describing his life with honesty and clarity, just confirmed all that I have always believed to be true of him."

Mary Bustamante,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding,I’m so glad I read this. I was fooled by the toxic press. I believed the twisted narrative created out of jealousy and hatred. I appreciate hearing the truth from Harry. This has been an awakening for me. I need to check facts. Im sorry Harry and Megan have been so poorly treated by paps and their own families. I am encouraged by their ability to live life on their own terms. He will always be royal. No one can take that away from him and his family.
Nina Donley,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible,"I have only read the first 32 pages. The writing is phenomenal. Simple, detailed, easy to read yet covering  all bases needed to tell a deep story with so much depth and elements. I clap for anyone who can write their own story as it is their truth, their story, their bravery. The truth we tell isn't padding for those in our lives. I have no right to discredit Harry or condemn him and feel he has done his best to go against the grain to fight for his path for him and his family. My heart goes out to Diana and William."
Janet Podell,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Touching, Warm and Believable","Gutwrenchingly  pure.  And  unabashedly honest.  It was hard to put down.  Only a few of the  things that were revealed (and blushworthy) could have been left out,  but there were so few of those it never distracted from the totality of the story.  Totally moving.  Well done Harry."
Mrs Emma Jackson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Balanced and human,"This book could probably win an award for having the most reported out of context excerpts used ever.It has to be read for anybody to have an opinion. Sound bites do not tell a true story. Both lovers of Harry and Meghan and haters do a disservice in trying to incite outrage. I’m a supporter of them but I did not come away hating anybody (okay, maybe a degree of dislike for Camilla but, like Harry, I hope Charles can be allowed to be happy)It is beautifully, movingly written. It is a book full of honesty and humanity. It describes a family affected by tragedy, held hostage by the press but who deep down are humans. There is a thread of love in everything that Harry has written. Both his love for them and theirs for him.I loved the book. I love Harry and Meghan even more.  I hope they all find reconciliation and peace.It has to be read if a person is going to have an opinion."
Ining Eduardo,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great memoir!,"Prince Harry is great story teller. I admire him even more.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enlightening and sad.,I enjoyed his history. Young prince growing up  in the monarchy. I felt he was alone and sad most all of his life. Except the short time he spent with his mother. The royal family appear to be cold and unwavering people. Especially William and charles.
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So revealing!,"Thank-you, Harry, for being so forthcoming and honest. We all have come to believe that the Royals have it so easy and luxuries abound. I never realized how difficult it is for your family to just live and love in this world. Bravo for being brave enough to tell your truth! God Bless!"
Grace Hewitt,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insightful,This was very insightful. I like that he made his family human. I actually empathize with Charles and William it’s an awful existence.I like that the book seemed fair and balanced. I appreciate his perspective and I believe it is well written. Great Job and I wish you and your family nothing but peaceful and loving days ahead..
Islandnugget,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Far better than I expected,"This book is not what I expected…it is not a tawdry re-hashing of family drama.  Instead, it is an exceptionally well-written journey into Harry’s life.  It is honest, sad, funny at times, and a reminder that pain and love are universal, regardless of title or role."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fascinating look at media corruption,Harry has earned my respect with this autobiography that takes you behind the scenes of the monarchy as an institution and its corrupt relationship with the tabloid press. Everything he says rings true when you think about how Diana was treated by the press as well. She'd be very proud of her boy.
Katrin Reichelt,Reviewed in Germany on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nichts bleibt auf Dauer verborgen,"Der Preis, den es kostet, aus der eigenen Familiengeschichte herauszutreten und über sie hinauszugehen: Wer auch immer mit diesem Schritt ringt, findet in diesem Buch jede Menge Erkenntnisse.Dass sich die Geschichte im englischen Königshaus abspielt, ist dabei nahezu nebensächlich.So, wie Diana eine archetypische Tragödie verkörperte, in der sich Millionen Menschen bis heute wiederfinden, verkörpert Harrys Biografie den Ausweg aus scheinbar unlösbaren Verstrickungen und Machtgefügen.Es gibt nichts auf der Welt, was nicht irgendwann ans Licht kommen wird. Wahrheit oder Lüge: Beides wird gleichermaßen schmerzen. Das wird in dieser Familiengeschichte überdeutlich.Fazit: You have to choose your battles."
Erin E Lamb,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"An excellent, no holds barred, sensitive portrayal of life in the world’s most famous family. An indictment of the British press corps and their relationship with it. One of the most public stories in the world told for the only time ever by the person involved in it."
Monty's Mom,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So interesting,"Very thoughtful. The extent of his military service came as a surprise to me. The insights into the royals were not surprising,  however. As Harry said, it's a family whose riches were built on power, me first, and the enslavement.  I think Diana would be proud. He does warts and all including his own."
buddhabudi,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,wouldn’t have missed this for the world!,"Thank you, Harry, for revealing the truth of your life with all its trauma, struggles and the glorious adventures all over the world.

Kathleen Veit,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read,To read his reality is truly a gift. He never throws his family under the bus and holds back so much more.  Honestly makes me feel sorry for those he left behind who are not allowed to think freely.  His mother would be so proud of him for finding his own way
bjm,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent read,"A brave accounting from the only person who could give it; at times poignant and also perhaps at times too honest, it resonates with this reader as someone who has been lied to, manipulated, and gaslighted. Standing up for yourself and speaking your truth with compassion is worthy of praise and support."

It is very well written. Doesn’t come across as bitter or whiny as much of the press has tried to lead people to believe. Shame on the media for the nasty leaks leading up to the books release. I tried my best not to read any of the leaks prior to reading to book. Well done, Harry!"
MBJ,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was worth reading!,I think this book is even better than I thought it would be. I applaud Prince Harry for being so honest.

Ally,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartbreaking,fascinating, tragic, uplifting, and enlightening…A must read!","If you only read one book this year, this must be the one! If you can, purchase the audiobook. His is a voice that does not disappoint! Well worth my time and the money!From the first paragraph, Prince Harry’s voice (both in audio and written format) is warm, clear, and engaging. He has an eloquent and at times romantic style in his prose. He paints a beautiful and compelling picture from the first sentence. There is longing and urgency in his style. It pulls you in very effectively.It’s so rare to have a peek behind such a curtain! His account of life, love, loss, strife, challenge and learning inspire us all to do better, once we know better.It is brave, and at times unsparing of himself and of others. It is scathing when it comes to the role of the British media as relates to the royal family. It is tragic to have an intimate account of how that has played out during his lifetime. The only redemption of such loss is the account of the life he has built with Meghan.Finally, there is a sense of destiny and of fate. It was always going to be this way, and yet, who could foresee or imagine it?One feels that, somewhere, Diana is immensely proud of her son."
M. Walters,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting read,Take what you want from this book. Remember that it is sometimes the memory of a child being told by the adult years later. Think about the childhood memories you may have. I believe what Harry is telling us. It appears that the Institution has a lot of similarities with politicians.
Mellyn,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His story his words,"Much respect to Harry and Meghan for what they've gone through.

naomi monschein,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harrys Story,"This book was written with great emotion. Harry told his story without hate only remorse, that his family had allowed the press to ruin his and Megan's life. It was the same thing that had happened to his mother.

This isn't an attack on RF, its a righteous response to British media.Its funny in parts, PH has a true squaddies sense of humour, its incredibly sad, it invokes a lot of thoughts of what could have been if Princess Diana had not been hounded to her death by the paparazzi. I've finished the hardback, will be keeping it on the bookshelf, its a keeper! And I'm about to buy the audio version - I've read his words and I think it's equally important to herald them"

Tracy Lykins,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written, engaging","I read memoirs, so many memoirs.  Famous, not famous, old, young, it makes no difference.  This was a delight and one of the better ones.  Beautiful written.  I read it not as Prince Harry's memoir, but the memoir of a young man dealing with grief, trauma, growing up, moving out, moving on, and family.  Well done."
She's Natural,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This Magnum Opus Memoir,"From page 1 to 410, Prince Harry takes the reader (me!!) on an incredibly thrilling and moving ride through his life. I feel like now I know The Prince of The People’s Hearts! I can’t wait for Part II or Book II. Such a brilliant read. Just stunningly beautiful, poignant, and powerful."
Ruby Rabb,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very interesting,"This us a well written book.  I felt there were a little more military stories than needed, but then again it was a big portion of his life.  It seems like he should have been hugged more after his mom's death, rather than left on his own to try to explain the unexplainable and maybe he could have developed more strength.  Sad for the whole family it all came to this."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I thought it would be,"So many things could be said about this book. Yes, there appear to be scores to be settled, and a lot of palace drama which is not at all surprising. What surprised me was the understanding of how much the monarchy allows itself to repeat mistakes over and over. Who pays?  Also, the book illustrates an understanding of generational trauma and the Prince not wanting that for his kids. A good and salty read,"
Blissfull,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare spearheaded the bestseller lists,"I love love this book. His voice is so soothing. Also Harrys narration is the best I’ve ever listened too. His description of any situation one can visualize what is happening. This book was well written, well narrated.

AlyKat7070,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT BOOK!,"Wonderfully written, honest and raw memoir. I loved it! Prince Harry’s courage in sharing his complicated and sometimes heartbreaking life is inspiring. The rawness of this memoir made PH more relatable. It takes massive courage to share one’s life in such detail. He’s inspired me! Harry knocked it out of the park! Bravo!"
Hank Reads!,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extraordinary.,"In a clear, decisive voice, Captain Wales describes the surviving the traumatic death of his mother and the painful narcissism of his father. His wife's love offers him both an emotional and practical life line allowing him to escape from the stultifying bondage created by financial control and immutable protocols. I was deeply moved by his story and his humility."
M. Kirby,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I Could Meet You!,Unique writing style. Presents a very sensitive soul struggling to survive in and understand his surroundings with no support from seemingly anyone. Truly a sad commentary on  dysfunctionality created over time within the family expected to behave royally while  transitioning from the society in which it originated to the current society.
Donna R. W.,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Original,"I am so appreciative that Harry wrote this book. The general public was told so many untruths and it is a blessing to now receive his side of all the media versions. My prayers are extended to Harry, Meagan, and the children. Don't give up, trust God, and always stand for truth! You are loved and supported!"
MG,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,What courage!,"The cost of owning his own story, including the unbearable pain and trauma he has lived with is of course plain for us all to see.  Sometimes, however, you do lose your family by choosing your mental wellbeing and the chance to live authentically.  There’s almost nothing we don’t already “know”, or couldn’t somehow imagine, however,  the account of Harry’s own human experience behind the facade is heartbreaking, sobering and humbling.  I applaud his courage.  I send that young prince hugs galore - what cruelty to live a life so devoid of loving touch after his mother died.  The pain and trauma he suffered is palpable.  The best thing his family could do is read this book for themselves, word for word.  Yes, there will be perspectives and versions of facts, but I can only imagine their own buried pain and rage would be helped.  Go Harry!"
Tamiko,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A life of A Prince, Solider and Spare","I am not one who reads memoirs, but I knew this one would deliver!! To be born a Prince and the Spare ~ to be a solider and to know loss at the age of 12, you would think he would not have much to say. But oh he had so much to say. The audiobook is awesome to hear it in his own voice. I got both so I can hear and I can also read it. The best memoir!!!"
Georgia,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought it because it is of historical importance.,I study History and hoped find out about the less sensational parts of Harry’s life. The ghost writer did a very good job of describing Harry’s travels and how difficult being under constant scrutiny. Meghan does not come out well. I’m sure Harry has had mental health issues most of his life.He would have coped better at Gordonstoun.
Elinor Wymore,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful & inspiring,"I loved it all - eloquent, inspiring, visceral... it tells their story in a way that is easy to understand and sympathize with.

At great sacrifice to himself , the Prince sets the record straight. Well done, Sir!"

Jeri Wallace,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,interesting perspective,"I found Harry to be relatable. He offered insight on the differences between the brothers and their roles and challenges.  I did not find him to be disrespectful, but he has every right to feel that way.  The can exile him but defend a sex offender ( he does not go into detail about that- but I feel he could have if he truly wanted to trash his family)."
Margaret Musekwa,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healing,"Touching. Honest. Frank. And as a person who lost both parents at a young age(10 and 13), I could identify with so much, learn from so much. I never knew that my bad memory can be attributed to childhood trauma! To this day, I can't remember my father's. Thank you Harry."
Trinity,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who knew?,"What an insightful read.  A royal reveals what I expect many of us have experienced. The smoke and mirrors of family drama. This one just happens to be a public outing of a culture steeped in racism, superiority and glorified privilege. How can this environment be healthy for anyone?"
Jenn,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting,"A deeply personal and honest autobiography. The love Prince Harry has for his mother, father and brother leaps off every page. The love of his life appears three quarters of the way through the book. Hope this couple has continued success in their work and will continue to move forward together in happiness and love."
David J Warden,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A valuable historical corrective to the mountains of rubbish written about him,"Everyone with an opinion on Harry and Meghan should read this book - and especially every therapist because it's a fascinating case study of a human life laid bare. It's the least we can do, to make an effort to hear his side of the story. At 409 pages, it's quite an effort at times but there were moments when I felt moved to tears. Of course, it's only one side of the story, but a valuable first-hand corrective to the mountains of lies and drivel written about him. Why should we care? Because this is what our constitutional arrangements do to one family. We put them in a cage and treat them like animals for our entertainment. Shame on us and our press."
Mary Bradley-cox,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ghost-written memoir,"'Spare' was ghost written by JR Moehringer, an award-winning journalist. Prince Harry did not write the book himself - he just talked to Moehringer. It is an entertaining read, but please remember that you are not reading anything written by Harry himself - he admits that he was a dreadful scholar and finds writing (and reading) difficult. It is one long whinge about how awful life is as a member of the Royal Family. His memories of being awed by Prince William's new home is amusing - Harry & Meghan were living next door, and why they, apparently, had to buy a sofa from Ikea with Meghan's credit card is downright peculiar. Harry was left millions by his mother - had he spent it all?"
Tommy Lawrence,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great to hear the truth!,"After only knowing one side of the story from the press I didn’t make much judgements until now. I’m glad that this gave a great detail into the other half of the story surrounding Harry and Meghan. I hand on heart believe their story. We’ve all seen how manipulative and twisted the press can be, it’s appalling what they’ve done to this pair. More needs to be done when it comes to spreading of fake news to maximise profits, laws should be passed to stop the abuse of the press towards people in such positions in society. Lives have been lost because of it. I stand behind Meghan and Harry completely. Well done for being brave enough to stand up to it, your mother would be proud."

ReadingNinja,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grass is Not Greener.,"Prince Harry did a terrific job telling us his side, his story.

Xee,Reviewed in Germany on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's funny, honest and heartbreaking","Forget he's the Duke of Sussex and it's just a man talking about his life, his childhood, the loss of his mother and how that has affected everything in this life. It's funny, it is charming, and it breaks your heart how long he held on believing his mum was just in hiding and would one day come back. 10/10 would recommend if you like memoirs"
ac,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Informative,I haven't fin finished this book yet but felt I had to review because of all the bad press Harry is getting right now. When I read any book like this I try to picture the scene and how it could be perceived and almost half way through this book I understand Harry more.  We have to understand he does not come from a normal family and the press invasion would take its toll on anyone.. I have thought the media have always been liars in their take on most things they just want to sell papers and they can twist any head line to look bad when in fact half of it is untrue.  Its Harry's truth and thats all he wants to do is get it out there whether you believe him or not I know who's side Im on.
Jean Constance Gow,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing him tell his own story and correcting the lies,I like everting about this book. The way Harry read it.

You feel like you’re having a conversation and hearing them talk about their life story rather than struggling through a non-fiction book. Very insightful, and my heart breaks that the both of them had to go through all of this. From the historical viewpoint this is absolutely phenomenal."

DF Cawley,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest,I always worried that the royal family would not get counseling for the young princes after the tragic death of their mom.

erin,Reviewed in Australia on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Full of heart and soul,"I also could not put this book down once I started reading it. Can’t think of any other book, that I just had to read on the day of release. Harry forever won a place in my heart, the day of his beautiful Mum’s funeral and then years later, when  he was part of a documentary in Africa. He was cradling this beautiful baby girl who had unimaginable horrors done to her. His compassion was obvious. Not the Harry at all we saw constantly on the covers of magazines and papers.I’m disgusted with the tabloid press, I can’t believe what they get away with. It was just so refreshing to read the true account of events from Harry’s life (which by the way, we do not own). He has a lot of love for his family, but as he said, during his second darkest hour, they were not there for him. I don’t get the hate, never have, never will. I’m glad Meghan, Archie and Lilibet brought the sunshine back into his life. It’s been missing for a long time."
Lisa Ahmad,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and a must read book!,"This book is so engaging and it is so refreshing to hear the story from Harry himself after all of the rubbish stories from UK media:My highlights:1. I have more respect to Harry and Meghan for being able to fund themselves and not to use public money.2. I have more respect to Harry and Meghan to be able to still be alive despite all the setback against them especially with jealousy within the family.3. I always think of Meghan as more charismatic as compared to Kate. Meghan is clearly woman with brain and have accomplished and not just doing ribbon snipping with expensive dresses.4. I think UK royal is no longer valid now. It's better for the monarchy to be abolished and all of them learn to live using their own money especially now we have bigger crisis with underfunded NHS that threaten lives of many.5. I think focus is been made to attack Harry and Meghn because they are more popular than William and Kate. Boring stories do not sell newspaper and hence continuous news about Harry and Meghan.6. It is sad that in the palace, the advisors are mostly those with agenda including those who were trusted by the Queen."

Carrie B,Reviewed in Australia on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful read, very enlightening","I LOVED this book! FINALLY someone from the inner sanctums of the British royal family has been able to have THEIR voice heard, THEIR experiences without being silenced by ""outdated duty"" just to stay popular and relevant in the public's eye.This is a very moving account of what it's really like to live in the fishbowl of the royal family with all their crazy ideas, outdated protocols & one eyed opinion of how they are supposedly so much better than the average person.It's a raw and often times, flinching account of what actually happened behind those gilded doors of the palace and how the ""Firm"" will and can do anything, and I mean ANYTHING to keep that golden image up so the rest of the world doesn't wake up and realize how outdated the royals are.It's at times heart wrenching to read about what his wife has been subjected to not only by the press but also from the hands of other members of the palace at large.  None of us can know exactly what happened but I believe everything Prince Harry has spoken of in this book absolutely rings true!  I applaud him for having the royal balls to be a real man and step out from the gilded cage.  It's truly a great read from cover to cover."

Gives a great insight into Prince Harry from his own words and perspectives. As Duchess Meghan stated in their Netflix series, ""Isn't it better to hear our story from us?"" Yes, it is!!!!!  Thank you to Prince Harry for his candor and honesty."
Annie,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"It is a truly well written, thought provoking and emotional read. I am happy that Harry told his own life story unfiltered. Never again will I believe any royal story without a name attached. Royal sources, palace sources or some one close to  the principles will not be sufficient. I recommend this historical first hand account to all those who seek the truth."
Lena-Rose Orlando,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this book,I believe this book is a true representation of life as a royal. The “firm” truly is the force behind the throne and decides how and what the public is told. Enjoyed this book and wish Harry and Meghan a peaceful future.
Christine,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Intrigued!,"Trying to be normal in a dysfunctional lineage of upbringing and distorted perception of life,  I give this young man much credit for taking a stand, trying always to be real about his struggles and loss in life. Wish him and his wife and family peace and love."
Cancer Survivor,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Book,I finally received the book; it was placed in the community mailbox.  I thought it be delivered straight to my door.  I was so thrilled to receive it.  I started reading it and had to force myself to put it down and go to bed!!!!!
Janet M. Stickels,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,Enjoyed reading this book. The complete honesty that Prince Harry shared. Can’t imagine how hard this must have been. Yet so cathartic. I believe you Harry. I am also so very sorry how alone you were. Very well written. Would highly recommend.
Susan Cameron,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read!,"A wonderful read. Fascinating information about Harry’s military training and the descriptions of Africa. But more than that,  I appreciated the honesty throughout. I have a clearer understanding about the turmoil he and Meghan faced in respect to the British press."
Mary-Rose,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and insightful memoir,"This book was MUCH better than I expected.  Yes, it was ghost-written; yes, it is from one person's viewpoint only.  But Harry's own voice clearly comes through - honest, modest, hurt, needy, likeable.  I have seen a lot of misquotes from those trying to dismiss the book but the reviews and numbers sold speak for themselves.  It was so compelling I read it in one day.  I just hope Harry, Meghan and the children manage to survive the nastiness emanating from Buckingham Palace and make a good life for themselves away from the pain."
Lou16,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t put it down,"I’ve been unable to put this book down. It tells a very different story to the one the media presents and confirms a great many details. Harry comes across very well-clearly a life unlike many of us but I appreciated hearing from the horse’s mouth rather than the embarrassing trash ‘a royal source said’ about stupid non-stories constantly in the press and rehashed and recycled constantly like nonsense about waving and clothes.Worrying to see how easily the media and royal family control public perceptions. As 1930s Germany proved, too many people buy into the popular narrative and are easily turned to hate.Am no fan of the royals but this is one royal I respect who’s now living his life without relying on taxpayers, rumours and rivalry. I hope Harry’s no longer a fan of killing animals too-unlike the rest of his family.Highly recommend."
Gerilda,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy Prince Harry was finally able to speak freely,This book made me so sad but happy at the same time. There’s nothing more libel liberating to be free to be able to tell your story without people twisting or making stuff up. Congratulations Harry and may god keep shying in your beautiful family. Sooo good he is finally free ❤️
janis k ecker,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heart wrenching,"Such gut wrenching pain and sorrow!  I felt a kinship with Harry in wondering how people we love and who supposedly love us could be so blind each to the other. A truly touching and enlightening story of great loss, and finally the redemption of great love."
Nicole,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great autobiography,"I have read a lot of autobiographies, this is one of the best. My hat is off to Prince Harry and his ghostwriter. I was hoping for more about his childhood, but what I got seemed searingly honest and not at all whiny or self-serving."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional story telling.,I am an avid reader love good story telling. An author most be able to pull me into a story. The sights smells and emotions. Prince Harry's Spare did that.  I heard him.  I heard his heart. Love love loved it.  Gonna start my second read.
Deborah B,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful read,This was a great read for me because I remembered a lot of the events with his mom - and how they brutally attacked her in the press - no one should be prosecuted as she was and he is now going through. Thanks  u for the great read.
Anne Foley,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A story no one else could tell,This well written story is fascinating. It takes you inside the life of fame that few people possess. I am so happy that this family took the steps they had to take to change the direction of their lives and prevent another tragedy. I wish them peace and purpose.
N Quates,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't put this down!,"I would recommend this book to anyone willing to see Harry's point of view.It was. In my opinion, a telling from the heart.I hope he and his family can now live a life full of joy and happiness."
Dileni Ratnayake,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully written!!,"It made me cry, laugh, reflect, pause, muse,  ponder. A story of the duality of life - with all it's grief, trauma, euphoria, joy. A story of the lust for life, the complexities and miracles of it and the journey to live it against all odds."
Annie,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Truth,"What a revealing and honest account of Prince Harry's life. Heartbreaking in many areas and unbelievable how the paps were allowed to harass to extreme both Prince Harry and Meghan. Totally empathetic with their decision to leave the UK; in the same situation, who wouldn't do the same? Very sad about the break in communication between Prince Harry & his brother and father. This isn't what Princess Diana would have liked for her boys. They really must try to find a middle ground, both for themselves and their children.  Life is too short and they shouldn't leave it until it's too late. I wish Harry, Megan & their beautiful children a happy life in America where I think they will be able to live something near as possible to a normal life."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gripping…,"You won’t be able to put this book down. Heartbreaking.

D. D.,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow I am impressed,I dont know what I expected from this book but it definitely exceeded all of my expectations. This is such a raw vulnerable account of Prince Harry’s life. It’s his legacy. I loved the way he told his story. It was such an emotional but also somehow easygoing read. Loved it. Highly recommend.

LR Burgess,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Same soul injury to Harry, press lies....again","A beautiful glimpse into the life of a beloved royal, Harry. He tells it like it was for him and Meg.  And yet, still hounded by the press with over focused family turmoil. All love and survival.  Nothing to see here folks, no wreck to gawk at, move along now."
NEW,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredibly Honest, Touching and Beautiful","I really loved this book!! Other than Diana, never in history has a royal ever been so candid. As someone whose worked in celebrity PR for almost 20 years, I also found it fascinating and refreshingly honest. This is a must read."
Susan Philpotts,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Riveting, captivating. Harry gives us honest account of life as a Prince. The good, bad and ugly.",Loved the book. Could not put it down once I started reading. Spare in the true sense of the word opened my eyes about the royal family. Not a good look the way Harry was treated. Good for him in revealing it all. Now hopefully he can have peace.
Catalina Diaz,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,well written and eloquent!,"Prince Harry really gave his all in this book! this book is well written and very interesting. i never felt bored for a moment. for me, this was a fun page turner. Prince Harry has a gift for story telling in a way that not many celebrity authors can do!"
Michelle A,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best memoir I’ve ever read,"Haunting, gut wrenching, visceral, raw, funny, poignant, emotional , romantic, beautiful. Definitely the best memoir I’ve ever read. Written in the style of a novel. Completely engaging and so honest. There will be moments that you ugly cry, laugh out loud and do both simultaneously."
Mel,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, Interesting Book",I highly recommend Spare to everyone. It gives a lot of insight into an otherwise closed environment. Thoughtfully written. Sections left me appalled at the viciousness towards a human being. Others sharing the joy of friends and new love were a pleasure to experience. Well done Harry!
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Book!,"Well written, well explained and answers lots of questions I had. Good warning on irresponsible journalism. We are all responsible when good people do nothing in the face of tyranny.  I am also questioning the behavior of the royal family. They need to rethink their priorities.  I believe the author."
Absolutely smitten,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute thriller no wonder SPARE has smashed records,"Wow wow wow am so glad I pre-ordered this book. Couldn't put it down. Just finished it today and am left wanting more. Easy ready, emotionally engaging, intellectually stimulating, so sad at times I shed a tear or 2 and yet so hilarious in parts, made me laugh out loud. Nothing beats hearing it from source without all that media bias, propaganda, misinformation, selective truths and untruths, trash and hatred. If all partners stood as steadfast and made the sacrifices Harry and Meghan have both made for each other, I believe this world would be a much better place. Reading about their divine love and romance warms my heart. It will make the jealous haters even more jealous. For me, the love in this book is worth more than all the jewels and titles in the world. So Harry, just as you said to Meghan, in the acknowledgement section of your book, I also here say to you thank you, thank you, thank you."
Kindle Customer Beverlie Beck,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"True, sweet story","I realize how the British press pits one party against another to sell copies.  Diana vs Fergie, Chas. vs Andrew, Eliz. vs Margaret, Wm. vs Harry, Edw. VIII vs George VI, now Catherine vs Meghan.  Harry has been hounded all of his life.  Peace for him and his little family!"
Donna C.,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A most moving book,"This book was insightful of the joys, sorrows, pains, experiences (good and bad) and certainly love of Prince Harry’s view of his life. It was not a pr piece. Having experienced some family and sibling issues, it reopened my memories for my life. I hope to consider improving my own relationships. Wish Prince Harry and Meghan decades and decades of love and success. Thank you for sharing."
Theresa Mohawk,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compassion,I am still in the midst of reading SPARE. I cannot put it down.

Desirée,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read,"Candor, rawness, jokes...nice reading his inner thoughts knowing that one is not alone.  Each processes things in our lives similarly.  Recommended to my family; actually bought 2 extra copies to share.  Felt loss when burying the remains; cried...worth a read! Colourful descriptions used!  Very British too!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, touching and heartwarming","Just finished this. The context behind all the soundbites, this book really makes you feel that you know this man, faults, virtues and struggles. It's not only insight into the mechanics and reality of being born royal, but a searing indictment of toxic masculinity and the belief that vulnerability is a weakness."
debbie t,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quite a beautiful read.,It is a beautifully written book with deep emotion and sadness. But I am amazed at how Harry's underlying love and hopefulness for his family permeates through the entire book. I wish him and his family peace and happiness. I will read it again and again.
B. McGraw,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read,"Very easy to read without feeling mawkish or embarrassing. It’s even amazing how context really changes all the salaciously leaked tidbits. I’m not at all a fan of the royal family but I felt like insight like this might be fascinating, and it was. It was also very sad."

But if what is happening in your house is hurting you or your family, I think it needs to be dealt with. I love the connection that they have and the everlasting love and faith that they shows to the world. Throughout all they went through they came out stronger. GOD bless you all."
Melissa Hill,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A beautiful look into his life from his perspective,"Very well written, and I absolutely loved reading his story and his perspective. The majority of the book is just getting to know him and going into raw detail about his thoughts and experiences. I reads very intimate and honest from his internal point of view. I loved it."
shortie,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional,I am amaze that Harry and Meghan still have the capacity to love and in awe that he could still love his family after all they put him through. This book was well thought out and written. Everyone should  buy a copy and read it.
Melissa Alaiwat,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A story both heartbreaking and beautiful,So much to say. It was not always an easy read but just because of the emotions knowing what  Harry had endured. His mother would truly be so proud of the family he has built but even more protected. If only
Chrissie,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully written & heartbreaking!,"Just want to give him (& Meghan) a hug!!! Harry’s bravery and courage to keep going after a lifetime of horrific treatment is incredible. He writes so beautifully, holding his hands up to his mistakes etc. I just really hope one day (sooner rather than later)  the press are held accountable for their vile behaviour (not just to him but so many). I certainly will never be clicking on a tabloid website again!! I truly wish Harry , Meghan and their beautiful family peace and happiness for the rest of their lives. Love wins! 💗"
kelly p.,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I knew it would be!,"Such a great book! Harry is funny, charming and poignant. I can't imagine how horrible the paps made his life, his family's life, but he really opened my eyes to just how repulsive and destructive the media is. I wish him and his little family all the best."
Twinkle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,An interesting book.,The book has a compassion inducing beginning which focuses on Harry's childhood.  The second section focuses on the army days and the final section is about Megan and their relationship with the royal family.  The text is by turns shocking and tragic.
Maria del Pilar Pena,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book! Well done Prince Harry!,"Wonderful memoir. I love how well written this book is. Prince Harry let us in his story, in his own words, sharing his life experiences which have shaped him into the remarkable man he is today. I highly recommend this book."

Jessica Stewart,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book,I’ve never followed the royal family or actually have had that much interest in them. That being said I watched his Netflix special and found it really interesting. So I preordered his book (which is a first for me) and thought it was fabulous. It was well written and really interesting. I definitely recommend.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really interesting read,"I really enjoyed this book. It gives a lot of interesting information about how the monarchy works and also about his military training.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful and Touching,"After all the hype, I was not going to buy Spare. My curiosity got the best of me - and I'm glad it did. This is a gorgeously written and touching tale of a dysfunctional family (which so many families are - royal or not)."
Ruth Wallace,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest account,Reading Harry’s view of his life was a difficult painful read. His explanation of so many so called newspaper reports made so much more sense then the money grabbing newspaper headlines of the many times. I felt this is an honest account of how he has had to manage so many unrealistic expectations … such as a young child not being permitted to cry in public when his mother has passed… it has always upset me the image of those two boys following their mothers funeral cortège. It’s good to finally have an understanding of the cruelty and uncaring nature put upon them and the consequences of their so called family not protecting them at such a devastating time in their young lives. I am glad Harry has spoken his truth
irma suntay,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the read!,It gives one a better understanding of the lives they lead.

Mrs A,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and Interesting,I couldn't put this book down although I have read many books about the Windsors.

Jupmeister,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully, hauntingly written. Unflinchingly honest.","Amazing retelling of a story for the ages - by the man who owns the story himself.

Important topics addressed that concern not only his life but also society at large. Well done, Haz!"
Gabriela Garcia,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,HIS STORY TO TELL.,It’s amazing that people who follow the tabloids as truth-tellers really deny Prince Harry the opportunity to tell HIS story HIS way.Kudos to him for setting the record straight through such a captivating read.

The unimaginable pain remains just that. What he does with it is more the point now. Leading the fight against misinformation, especially in British media, makes sense.I look forard to more content from Harry and Meghan."

Three cheers for Harry.
marianne r. crocetto,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,"Its a true account of royal life., not what we always thought.

KristinaTheIntrepid,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His Story To Tell,"After 38 years of gossip and media mis/dis information written about Prince Harry, he is FINALLY telling his story.  His experiences as a prince, a son, a brother, a grandson, a veteran, a friend, a father, a husband, just a human being.  The read is quite lovely and his experiences evoke more emotions than there is room on this form to write.  Enjoy."
ANNIE,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting and easy read,"I enjoyed this book.  It was well written, entertaining, and an easy read.  I am on the fence, leaning towards Harry's side, after reading his story.  On the one hand, many of his complaints seem like common sibling rivalry that most families experience.  On the other, I love a man who will stand up for his wife regardless of the personal costs."
JMNNH,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely heart-rendering,"Prince Harry has spoken his truth, hopefully the world and his British family will hear it and learn from it.

Marsha christoffel,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great account of his life,"Love the book. Never realized how viscous the British tabloids were. Harry’s story was on point with his family. His experiences with depression, his mom’s death, dad and brother were sad. Glad he married such a strong woman. Wish him much happiness."
K. Markle,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this book.,"You can tell a lot of effort went into making this entertaining as well as revealing some of the harder times in his life. Hope he and his family are blessed with good fortune, long life and lots of love."
Cynthia T.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was an interesting read.,"It rings true because he shared stories that didn’t make any of them look good. Including sometimes himself and Meghan. It’s the good, the bad, and the ugly. I hope the book can bring about changes that will ensure better lives for Charlotte and Louis."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,"This was a very interesting and great way of seeing how the Royal live. How autocratic their lives are and how if you aren't the main character, you are used and abused by even your closest family for their own gain . Well written ."
peggy lacy,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Harry coming to terms with his life and loss of Diana,"He poured out his heart and life to explain why he gave up his country and life to live in America. Too much detail of his military life but that is really all he has ever done in his, life career wise ,Thanks to Harry and Meh for giving back to all the kids and veterans ,"
DROSE,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyone deserves to tell their OWN STORY!,"Bravo Harry. This book is powerful, heartfelt, meaningful, and honest. None of us on here can imagine the struggle of growing up in the way Harry did. The concept of a Royal family is so antiquated and in our modern society, every person should be able to speak their truth. This is a great read; I couldn’t put it down."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Prince Harry!,"I just received my book yesterday and I can't put it down. Prince Harry writes from the heart and I'm so glad that I chose to read it. It's excellent, well written and it's evident that he still grieves for his beautiful mum, Diana. He's very much like her and he shares her beautiful heart."
eviet,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His story,"It was nice to read his story in his own words. I found that laughter, love, and tears has filled his life so far. Wishing Prince Harry and his beautiful family peace. May they one day reconcile with family across the pond."
L. King,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An inside look,"Did I need to know about certain anatomical parts? Probably not, but that, as well as many other personal tidbits, are what drew me ever deeper into the life and times of Haz. It's refreshing to hear this perspective, and have it spinned."
psychnurs,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,very interesting book,"It's really sad to learn the way the royal children are raised. Not great educations, no experience with real life, every move choreographed for them. I hope Harry and Megan and their children are happy and healthy and make a good life for themselves in the US."
Ivy Saini,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic read.,Very informative and verified numerous things that I 🤔 were going on for years in that monarchy. Things have been happening for years all one has to do is check history (go back 200 or 300 yrs plus and a pattern is seen). I hope people get a deep understanding of how cruel some folk are.
Susan C,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,In his own words.,"You read headlines about the Royal Family and never, ever know if what you are reading is true or not. I believe this book gives you the truth. I thought it was very well written. And heartbreaking in many ways. I pray for clarity and love for the whole Royal Family!"
B.G. Dale,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read,"It's nice to finally get Harry's POV after all the negative, mean and nasty British tabloid garbage.  It's a shame our media published so much trash about the couple before the Netflix documentary and again before the book came out.  Speculation instead of information doesn't cut it."
Granite2014,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truthful and compelling,I haven’t enjoyed a good autobiography in quite a while and I am enjoying this on kindle. It’s truthful and feels authentic. It’s interesting to hear his viewpoints and history especially since the media in the UK acted so unjustly against his family. I recommend this book 100%. What a wonderful person he is. You won’t regret the purchase. If anyone here doesn’t like the book it’s because they chose not to before they started. So see for yourself.
Solange Cross,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Personal insight on harm caused by and the sinister power of 'tabloid/click bait' press,"'Spare' has several light-hearted moments, but mostly, it reads as a moving and well-written insight on the harm caused by and the sinister power of the tabloid and social media in the UK and beyond.  The furore and misleading headlines surrounding this book before and since its publication sadly confirms this.  The value of a free press, committed to reporting facts and holding people and governments to account is undeniable.  Except, that this is far from what the British tabloids and click-bait, hate-driven media is about.  The book shines a light on the lengths that the tabloid machine is prepared to go in order to control and manipulate the narrative and influence public opinion.  I hope that Harry's account will lead people to understand that the tabloid press's manipulation is not limited to narratives about the author, but crucially, it permeates to more important matters such as voting, climate change, human rights, etc.  Well done Harry!"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I gorged on it.,"Well written, absorbing and emotional.  I tried to set aside the royalty part and just focus on the fear, anxiety and abandonment issues that plague us all.  Harry made it easy to see HIM.  I also enjoyed his growth, and was impressed by his work ethic."
Riley’s holiday list,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better than reported,I thought that there was so much more that happened in Harry’s life than expected.  He never experienced normal nor his father or brother. He suffered mentally and everyone should hope he has a wonderful life ahead .
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I've never been really into royal drama, but all the recent talk of this book made me curious.  Such a well written book from the heart.  I highly recommend it!"
Phil Moree,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyed very much,Written very well. Laughed at some of the things he talked about himself. Talks about the love for his family. If you are looking for dirt you want find it. It is more about him growing up into the person he is today.
Alisha ,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well done, Harry!","We are proud of you for being a role model. You are breaking generational curses, healing from your trauma and in the process attempting to show your family what life could be if they allowed themselves to heal too.I hope you find pure joy, you deserve it!"
just another romantic but worth reading. loved it#,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,He may be a Prince but he has problems like everyone else,I felt this memoir was honest and at times sad. It was a glimpse into the life of the royal family. I felt like they didn't care about him even BEFORE he met Meghan. its good he broke away from that life.
Pat Hill,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,In awe,"I married the same year as Princess Diana and had two children. Thank you, Prince Harry, for your honesty. I enjoyed the book.  My wish is for many blessings to you and your family. May God watch over you all, always"
J W,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and layered.  Read with an open mind.,"This is an excellent book with many layers.  My first impression is that the Duke really loves his father. I could go on and on about the other issues, but you should  read it for yourself.  History will reflect well on the book."
Dolores,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,A World Revealed,There is lots an ordinary American can say about Royalty but we will never be accorded an inside look similar to Spare. I liked its basic honesty despite the fact that the author is one of the most recognizable people in the world. The book is beautifully ghost written and it would be nice to know the author.
Stickler for Accuracy,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,About time Harry got to stick up for himself and his wife.  The Royals still don't realize what an opportunity they turned away. It's a shame.  The book is a quick & interesting read.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshingly honest,"Prince Harry does not hold back. This truly is his side of the story from his point of view and I thoroughly enjoyed learning it from him. Raw, unfiltered, behind the scene glimpse of what his life has been like and inner palace workings. Highly recommend."
Hollidar,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read in 3 days,"Loved the book.  I think Prince Harry’s mom would be so proud of him for getting out.  Even though it wasn’t what he wanted, I hope he finds peace and happiness.  It’s a sad book to read, but really well written and a page turner.  Highly recommend!"
Cheryl L Ellison,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read this!!!,"This is not about being kind or loving royal family.  it's about how this child, grown man was bullied with the press so he was made to feel awful.  This is not a warm, fuzzy family and bless him for having the guts to finally stand up to them.  I wish him the best and hope you do too."
Crazy Shopper,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,outstanding,"This is a fantastic book. Harry is just telling his story and he does not attempt to hurt anyone in his family. He is lucky he has survived and healed emotionally after how he lived prior to therapy and Meghan. I hope William gets therapy, he would be much happier."
Vany Vélez,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully Written,"This book was written beautifully, with candor, love, pain and humor. It is a story about unrequited love from those you need it from the most and how it shaped his story. It made me emotional at times. Especially the epilogue. Great Read"

Carol Sanders,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!,"I couldn’t put this book down!

Joanne,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you for telling your story!,"I felt is was an honest forth coming story of what was happened vs the media sordid headlines. I appreciate him letting us all take the ride of a wonderful, painful, joyful life lived this far."
christine,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,a whole new light…,Easy read.  Engaging story from beginning to end.  Sure shines an interesting light on royal life. Originally I thought he should just talk to his family and not air this in a book….clearly he couldn’t or at least he didn’t think he could…
Deirdre,Reviewed in Australia on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,And now we know...,"Finally we get Harry's story, unfiltered by the Palace or the media, and it's exactly what I thought it would be. Shocking, heartbreaking, amazing AND inspiring. I've always been a fan of both Harry and Meghan, and felt there was so much more than the official lines (or lack of) and the BS headlines that sound more like they were written by wannabe J Jonah Jameson's than real human beings.Harry, Meghan and their children are human, just like the rest of us, and I wish them all the happiness and safety in the world, just like the rest of us are privileged to have. Stop buying into the media industry's interpretation of life on ALL levels.Haters gonna hate, and that is the saddest part - the haters will refuse to read this brilliant book filled with so many lessons on family, communication, being human and doing good things in spite of what people think they know about you."

Sheila Ellis,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it!,"I enjoyed this whole book. I learned alot  about Harry's life that I never knew. Why the Royals are so up in arms about this the only thing I can say is, If the shoe fits King Charles than wear it!"
jon bradley,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,very moving,"I wasn’t expecting to be so moved and appalled by what Harry has had to endure since his mother’s untimely death over 25 years ago.The bad guys in the story are still the gutter press who, for reasons known only to themselves, continue to sanction the harassment of certain people who they decide are either intrinsically evil or forever sainted.Harry’s insider view is something that should be absorbed as good primary source knowledge of the workings of the dysfunctional royal family and their perverse relationship with the press."
Crista,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The life of a royal you won't want to miss,"Harry's life has been a wild and enlightening ride.

Victoria Lockhart,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing book!,"Absolutely amazing read! This book is very well written, easy to read, emotional and diplomatic.

Deb,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and vulnerable read,"It was a heartfelt and vulnerable read. As someone who is always interested in the royal family I wasn’t sure what to expect. However the retelling of some of Harry’s most vulnerable moments that shaped is live was touching. You can easily see the the fishbowl he escaped from to protect his family. Wishing him, Meg, Archie & Lili all the best! Thank you for telling your story tastefully."
Cynthiaelle,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read!,I have the physical book but I also highly recommend getting the audiobook. Listening to Prince Harry read it takes the memoir to another level.A personal look into his life told by him rather than the media. A+
Rita Turegano,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Here is the Truth,He had every right to put this book out so we could see what he’s had to deal with and his mother had to deal with.

Pamela R. Cantrell,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Read,An honest forthright story about Prince Harry’s life in his own words.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Book,"Enjoyed this book very much. To have things in truth (Prince Harry’s) words &  not tabloid was inspiring. Not sure why Palace would out him for this book, did not find anything that was particularly outrageous against The King, Camilla, Prince William or Princess Kate. Just a man trying to find his place within a very complex family ."

Sherri Linkoff,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grace under pressure,"Your decision to tell your story with your voice in your words is brave and courageous yet often heartbreaking.

Dorothy Maguire,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Team Harry!,"I read the book in one day. I give him a lot of credit for getting help and telling his truth. I’m sure he held back on telling the really bad stuff. Growing up around all of that and surviving, without his Mom, is nothing less than amazing. Royalty is antiquated and things need to change."
Cindy Davis,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thought provoking and heart warming,"This book was well written and struck universal themes- complicated family dynamics, elemental fears for the safety of the ones you love, and the frustration of not being heard.

Pratik Shekhar,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare the Sussex,"This book is nothing like what is being portrayed in the media.

Keith Miller,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshingly honest,"I have read this book in three days, I don’t read a great deal normally so this is a first for me. I couldn’t put this down it was compelling reading and I thoroughly enjoyed every word. I have always felt that Prince Harry and his wife Megan have been badly treated by the press and by some of the British public, Even people in trusted positions inside the ‘institution’ have betrayed them to their own ends. this book explains, with humble honesty and righteous grievance,  what went on behind the scenes, information that the average person would never have access to. And shows how facts have been warped and twisted to suit various  personal agendas. It also shows how the suits within the palace walls, who have far too much power and influence, have failed to support Prince Harry and Meghan when they needed help the most.  I have the upmost respect for Prince Harry and Meghan and although I never contributed to it, I am ashamed that my country has allowed the press to rampage over their lives and their futures and fed lies to the gullible. They have hounded this lovely couple out of our country and we are the poorer for it. I feel angry and have no recourse to the gutter press other than to write this review. I’m sure there are many who will agree with my thoughts and for those who don’t … well shame on you"
Kathleen Edelmuth,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Truth and Fiction?,"I wanted to read this book, which I did in 3 days, even though friends said ""why read it?""  I am a follower of the Royals and make no apology for being so.  Comments on book:1.) I do like the format.  It's an easy read.  Even if Harry did have help.2.)  I believe some of what he said.  But, I do not believe all of it.  There are two sides to every story.3.)  I do not like the trashing of the family.  And, wow, he does do that.4.)  Way too much about his military experiences.  We get it, Harry, you were a soldier.5.)  Here's an error.  I live in Memphis where he attended Guy Pelly and Elizabeth Wilson's wedding.  In the book it is called ""the deep south"".  Not true, we are the Mid South.  And proud of it.6.)  This book will hurt him.  Forever.  To malign William, Kate, Charles, and Camilla in writing will always be on the front burner.  Never the back burner.  Perhaps he was pushed by ""someone else"" to write it.  Big mistake.7.)  I did learn a lot of the workings of the Palace.  That was somewhat harmless in the first two hundred pages, then he ""went for it"".  Another big mistake.8.) The font.  It's smaller than normal for a hardback book.  Very annoying.So, read at your own risk.  And your own time.  I am glad I did.  Just cannot give it a 5 because I do not know how much is true.  And I don't think we will ever know how much is true."
T. Krochman,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,a must read for any Royal watcher,Harry and Megan’s truth can no longer be denied.

Rachael Jones,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t stop reading.,I loved getting to hear his truth from his point of view.

This gives us such an emotional and raw insight to someone who has been so public but has never truly spoken out in his own words. He tragically lost his mother and had to grieve for the world to see. I strongly urge everyone to purchase this you will not regret it. He is definitely his mothers son
Book Lover,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best bits are the ones no one’s reporting,"I found this book to be better than I expected. While I appreciated all the insider info on the royals, the best parts were the parts no one has reported. I especially loved the section on his time at war. Recommend you read with an open mind—if possible."
Patricia Roach ,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Spare is a Fantastic read, brilliantly written. The author very candid and honest.","I loved everything, most resonated with me. I didn’t expect so much honesty from the Prince Author, especially as a person with his royalty background nor did I expected anything from his living life experiences will resonate with mine on this level and yet  here we are. I’m so grateful to have bought this book. Spare is a must read."
Jules ,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,very moving and well written,"What a heart wrenching story. The press should hang their heads in shame. They destroy lives and break people’s spirit.  It’s so sad what has happened between Harry and his family I hope they can heal and repair. Unfortunately I don’t think that’s possible when the institution is ran in such a way.  The men in suits. Gossiping courtiers. Press offices. They can virtually trust no one.I hope Harry finds peace one day.My only slight critique is that some of Harry’s observations of his brother and father seem a little paranoid, and unfair. But that’s what the press have created unfortunately. He is a highly sensitive man and he just wasn’t cut out for royal life, much like his beloved mother. Too emotional for the Royal Family."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,It was very interesting to hear about about your life.Listening listening gave me a different perspective.  God bless your family.  May you all heal and one day be reunited with the rest of your family.
Susan J. Corona,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although I felt the military explanations were a bit long-winded, once getting through that the rest was truly interesting. I get a sense that Harry is just a regular guy, with regular feelings, but because he is a Prince we expect something otherworldly. I truly hope he finds peace."

Marie3,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The People’s Prince,Harry’s memoir tells of his love and dedication to his family. I read this book and felt his hurt. He grew up always having the media chase him and print their side now it’s his time! Yes!
RJ,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well-written and interesting, despite all the implications","Interesting, well-written (clearly with lots of help from a ghostwriter), insightful, and sometimes genuinely heartbreaking. Some parts certainly far too intimate, far too personal, but such is the memoir genre. Overall, I’d recommend to people who are interested in the workings of the RF behind closed doors. You must remember to take everything written with a grain of salt, as I’m sure there’s many sides to this story…In other words, everyone sucks here. There are no innocent parties in this mess."

Whether it's a 100 percent accurate, I am not sure.  It is what he remembered so I am sure other people are going to disagree.  Seems like a Machiavellian place to grow up.  The book is good."

Natasha Bogart,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His truth finally being told,This book is a beautiful much needed look into the life of a man who has had strangers tell his story his entire life.  I am impressed by his openness and ability to bring us into his own lived experiences.
Kiri Self,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking and from the heart,"It’s hard to put into words how I feel, right now after just finishing this amazing book. It’s probably the first proper truth we’ve ever had from our Royal Family, and I commend Harry for his remarkable bravery. He is a brave and kind and good man, that’s very clear. He has struggles with his family which I can (unfortunately) so well relate to. And he has been deeply traumatised by both his mothers entirely preventable death, and by his own war experiences. (My own grandfather, the first man to command a platoon of Gurkhas in the SAS wrote a very similar book about his own life and experiences in war.)I think mostly what I want to say is - I’m so sorry Harry and Meghan. I’m so sorry for what you’ve been through. You are heard, you are seen, and you’re not crazy. Well, maybe a little bit - crazy in love with each other 😆😍. I send you wishes of peace."
Nicole,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this book!,I loved this book! It clearly explains so much. Harry explained everything so well. I'm sorry he and Megan went through all this pain and I'm hoping they have found peace in America.

Kit V.,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Intriguing and Inspiring,"I'd seen the interviews and Netflix series so I didn't have expectations that I would find more in the book.  WRONG!  This bio fills in the details, corrects the falsehoods, and reveals the struggles of a young man dealing with grief, love, and family.  Added to that are the unique and often bizarre restrictions of being a member of the royal family.  Thank you for sharing your story, Harry.  And live your best life."
Katie D,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the read,"This book is stunningly warm, relatable, funny at times, and well-written. I can finally see where he has been coming from and why he would pen a book. For Harry, I desperately hope his family reads it."

D. King,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The prince in his own words,"Prince Harry has had others writing his narrative to his whole. How liberating it seems to be able to share his story, in his own words. Thoughtful, vulnerable, honest and humorous this book is a great read. Much admiration for this man."
NMP,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was worried to read this; but glad I did,It is critical to tell your truth. He has done that. No one shines in this family dynamic. The peek behind the curtain is not what you would expect. Gilded cages are so fascinating. I'm glad he has broke free.
Cha Cha,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I totally understand why they did what they did!,"While Harry was born into royalty, he was born into a family dynamic like the rest of us. He suffered a traumatic event as a teenager that impacted him as it would the rest of us. It was a great account. Thank you!"

Christina Jackson,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A bit surprised…,"I wish that he had released this first. This gives a great deal of context into all of the accusations made in the Oprah interview as well as the Netflix documentary series. I don’t think all of the details are true, but there is poignant self reflection, awareness, and a goodness in this man that makes me believe he is doing what he thinks is right and safe for his family—his wife and children."
Timothy Foster,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great work,"The story of a dysfunctional family who happen to be in the public eye.

Shane Dane,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,My kingdom for an editor,"As Di said, William like Charles, Harry like me and he likes her even now more than anyone except Meghan who shows up part 3. He dotes on her even when the late queen quips tiaras become you. Indeed hence the problem. Mostly Harry wants to do what no one can, redo history. He's unmade his royal bed, leave it at that."
Kt,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt & Introspective,"Prince Harry is his Mother’s son in every wonderful way possible. Truly enjoyed reading.

Nee Smith,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read,"This was incredibly well done. At many points sad and infuriating over the details of what Prince Harry has gone through, but also uplifting and heartwarming to see his growth from child to man.

Peggy Merten,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent read!,"I enjoyed this book so much. An honest account of his life as a royal. So well written and, in my opinion, with no finger pointing to the royal family, but to the press. Highly recommend this book!"
patty s,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly eye opening,"I don’t know what I expected but I definitely didn’t expect such a beautifully written book. Learning how Harry faced the aftermath of his mother’s death, it’s very heart breaking. Learning about the people in his world- he’s kind about them. Some have said this will be a bombshell book. But I see a sweet story of a good man who is being honest about painful memories."
Paper Crane,Reviewed in Australia on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A beautiful book!,"The media (most of which seems to have sped read the book, looking only for salacious gossip and ""bombshells"") have missed the lyrical beauty of this story. This is the story of Harry's childhood and life thus far. Wonderful detail, evocative descriptions—the Okavango Delta sections are stunningly beautiful (dismissed by the media as ""boring"")! I've bought both the hardcover and the audiobook and I love it! It's an intimate perspective of family life—both familiar to us on one level, and unfamiliar at the same time—filled with anecdotes, Harry sure knows how to tell a story! While the book was no doubt structured by JR Moeringher, the voice and details are all Harry—as are the accents (he does all the voices) in the audiobook. My advice would be to completely ignore the media—if you are at all interested in the Royal Family or Prince Harry—or just want a fascinating story about a guy growing up as the ""spare"" Prince, do yourself a favour and read this book—you'll enjoy it! It reminds me of Gerald Durrell's books about his kooky family and is incredibly engaging. Harry is powerfully expressive and parts of it are sad, but overall Harry commemorates the Royal Family (and his life in it) in a unique and affectionate way—with a great deal depth, humour and love."
Kay,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic and powerful,"Love reading directly from the horse’s mouth, rather than from the British press who very clearly have a hateful agenda (evident with how their pre-release leaks stripped the story of context and were spun to make the book sound ridiculous). Simply untrue when you read it with the full context. It’s been highly powerful to get peek behind the workings of the institutions that shape public opinion. The book is hilarious - Harry’s cheeky personality shines through; visual description is beautifully done. Despite living a different life from most of us, there are many relatable human themes throughout. I sense this could be a tipping point for public understanding of how the wool is constantly being pulled over our eyes."
Joan sullivan,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,engaging,This book is well-written and engaging. The common thread of the ridiculous paparazzi in the UK is sad and frustrating. Glad to see Prince Harry has found his place in the world.
Jill,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this!  Both the kindle version AND audiobook!,"Excellent.  Love being able to hear the TRUE story, finally.  It is absolutely despicable that the family puts ""The Firm"" over and above family.  And that they constantly fed trash to the muckraking British ""press"" just to get them talking about some other ""royal"" instead of themselves... So they threw Harry and Meghan to the wolves.  Repeatedly.Also,  this is heartbreaking.  Imagine growing up, being regularly reminded that you are only there in case something happens to the ""real heir"" (see photo - a quote from the book)  No child in the world should EVER be subjected to that.I wish Harry and Meghan the best, and all healing, health, happiness, and success.  As for the rest of them... I truly couldn't care less for such despicable people."

Nevertheless, a life journey is told by the protagonist, whom we rarely see and hear from, so we can understand. I didn't know much about Harry, as I'm not a consumer of tabloids or Royal news. His book transported me to a world unknown but a painful and healing process familiar. I'm glad I read it. Goodspeed Harry! Thanks for sharing."

The UK press has been out of control for decades and it’s easy to understand his frustration on many levels.It is interesting to hear his side.  The trauma of losing his mom at such a young age has had a significant impact on his life. I almost think they should have had Earl Spencer foster him. But they needed a “spare.”
AJSupernurse,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't put it down,"This was an eye opening reveal in what ""The Spare"" has to endure.

Mary J.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honesty,"The most honest, bare to the soul story of any book I've ever read. An odyssey of one person's journey through trauma, mistakes, and efforts to find love and enlightenment. This is a man whose acquaintance I could value, whose compassion I would rely on, whose insight I would trust."
Shelby Austin,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Emotional.,"This book makes it very clear the emotions Harry felt growing up and how he feels now. There is no mistaking the truth behind his words and how every event, cold shoulder, nasty remark, and cruel treatments, led him to where he is today.I found this book really well written and even without hearing him speak the words himself, you can feel the emotion."
L Jackson ,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry Longing to Be Loved by Family,I feel for Prince Harry. He comes across as a person who has been longing to be accepted and loved by family. All the fame and money can’t replace family and love.
Missy,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great read!!!!!,"I love the detailed explanation of his struggles and the clarification of some stories that were false in the tabloids.Harry is entitled to tell his story ! For many years, multiple narratives of his life and after he married Meghan from the tabloids which falsely shaped the perception of a lot of multitudes. History needs to be accurate, hence his side of the story to debunk the false narrative intentionally written by the tabloids."
Carrie Sparrevohn,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well Done!,"Insightful, readable, and very much a telling of the effects of childhood trauma which so many of us experienced in a million different versions. Thank you, Harry, for sharing your life with us!"

Bob Speer,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"Very well written. It is, as Anderson Cooper wrote, a study in grief. But it is much more, I believe.

Anna,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing read. Loved everything about it.,"Absolutely loved Prince Harry’s honesty, his self reflection, his kindness … loved reading about his work, his love story with Meghan, how he found happiness and joy in his wife and children.It was heartbreaking to read about his grief, how he tried to keep his mother alive while growing up and his struggle to come to terms with her death.Although we can feel the love Prince Harry has for his father, who comes through as a kind but traumatised man unable to be a better father, it was somehow surprising to read about Prince William. Talk about bullying, envy, lack of support for his brother growing up and when Harry finally meets the love of his life.Anyway, life in that gilded cage is hell on earth and I’m sure it completely changed the perception of many readers.I found the book gripping, well written and sincere. Highly recommend."
Ubephoebe,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A palace source said....actually Harry said and I believe him,"This is a simple book. It can be summarised like this. The Royal Family truly represents modern Britain. Dysfunctional. Destructively competitive. More concerned about image than substance. Entitled. Exhibiting false belief in privilege. Harry and Meghan, both of whom I have never met or know, have opted out. Good on you. Please enjoy your life knowing that many believe your story and sympathise with your suffering at the hands of the Press and others. Read this book and then read ""And What Do You Do"" by Norman Baker."

Jano,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Other Side,"Harry & Megan wanted off the Royal Press Rota. All working royals have to agree that photos & stories must be given to the members on the Royal Press rota first.  This means Harry or Megan couldn’t put a cute photo of their children on Instagram any time they wanted to. The royal rota get first jibsThey want to post their own photos when they want to. They want the freedom to control their own media. They wanted to remain working Royals but not to be on the Royal Press Rota.  In my opinion this is the main point, of this whole sad situation. Imagine men are hiding in trees or sailing past your seaside home, taking photos of your children playing in the garden or a garden party where people might be drunk or acting silly. These photos end up in tabloids.  Everyone has the right to privacy in their own homes & gardens including the royal family.This book is very easy to read, it’s amusing in places & Harry explains how the British Press & Media works for anyone in the public eye. Yes he has revealed some things he maybe he shouldn’t of, but had he not, we wouldn’t of got the full context of the story or understand a person’s personality.The tabloids have certainly used quotes from the book without context for click bait headlines & the public are wising up to “fake news”. & poor journalism Question everything you read including this book. At least Harry feels he has given his truth, it’s written down for history.Abolish the Royal Press Rota completely & insist on proper journalism not gossip from “secret sources”"
Monica ,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was what I was expecting…,"However, I really enjoyed it. It felt honest and real and so sad. The situations described are heartbreaking and the family betrayal was shocking. Glad I read the book."
Ishan Datta,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully written and painstakingly told.,"From the first couple of pages, it is obvious that this has been written with a great deal of sincerity and detail. It reads almost like a Shakespearean drama, but the conflicts and tribulations are painted with profound realism. Highly suggest to those who want a realistic take on the facade that has become “the Royal family” or the “Monarchy.” Also a great read for history buffs, regardless of the archaic ideologies being discusses."

MARIE ARCAND,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,you're the man Harry,"The world has watched him grow up, and he really comes into his  own. He tells his side with honesty and candor. I read how much he wanted to hug has grandma. that really brought home to me the he and total coldness in the family"
personofinterest,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth a read,"It is incredibly sad how so many people, all over the world, are ripping Harry to shreds, simply because he has dared to be different. He has written this book because he feels it is the only way to tell his side of the story, without any interference, lies or spin from the monarchy and their 'anonymous sources '.  Just why people are so aggressive towards him and Meghan, there's just no logical answer. However, these people REALLY, REALLY NEED to actually start to read this book.  It is nothing like the media have been making it to be.  It is actually extremely thought provoking and extremely interesting.  It is very sad and poignant in places.  For myself, it has really opened my eyes.  Growing up knowing from an early age you were just a spare to the heir - this was spoken about in his hearing - has to have some effect on anybody; has to effect their self worth in some way.  Losing his Mum they way he did has affected his whole life and made him who he is today. It is something he has never recovered from, that is obvious throughout the book.  He has also been used and abused by other members of the royal family, including his close family - yet despite this, he still has love for them; it is a pity they cannot see they are partly responsible for the sad situation that it has resulted in today and actually do something about it.  Charles to think of his son... William to think of his brother... Put the monarchy aside for once and instead put family and bridge building first.I would recommend everyone to read a copy of this book before passing judgement on Harry."
Juice Inla,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Diana would be so proud.,"Spare is heartbreakingly, charmingly, lovingly written… Harry really is all Diana.

Mom,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific!,Worth the read. Enlightening to see the struggles that are unseen by most.

Dot,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A MUST READ! A well-written”  “revealing.” Celebrity Memoir. Which makes it special,"Spare is unflinching, introspective, and well-written. Some passages are mundane, most are weighty. We get detailed insight into Harry’s personal feelings in the history of the monarchy and cultural significance of his position – Including tangible memories of his late mother, Princess Diana, with her icon status. A mixture of painful, shocking, bizarre, and, in some cases, downright jaw dropping revelations from Prince Harry. However it’s not a tell-all with no literary merit often churned out by celebrities. Moehringer’s impressive writing propels the reader quickly through the 416-page book. There are so many poignant passages, that give better insight into Harry’s life that are missing from the rabid press coverage of Spare. The tidbits were stripped of context. But in the book they do serve a larger purpose than spilling the tea.The rebel Prince is often funny, like the passage about his “frostbite penis.” The memoir is far from perfect, but as far as a celebrity memoir goes, this is one of the well-written”  “revealing.” Which makes it special."
Alice Balan,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly At it’s Best,"Spectacular book.

Alex,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read. Prince Harry has outdone himself.,I bought a physical copy as well as the audiobook as soon as I found out it was coming out. Listening to Harry share these intimate details are so humanizing. It is so interesting to hear how things work within the firm. Well done Prince Harry.
EthansMom,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Eh, it was ok. Would I recommend it? Probably not.","It's about a boy and his emotionally stunted family. But on the other hand, it's also capitalizing on problems other people, non-royal people go through everyday. Parents aren't always emotionally mature enough to have kids, siblings fight, as they grow older the disagreements might get larger with lifestyle choices. Honestly, probably 50% of the book was covered in some form or fashion already.I'm glad I got his side of the story. I'm sorry with what he's been through. I think it's awful that he has PTSD and his image important family decided therapy was not ideal because of what people might think. Or that his brother thought his therapist was brain washing him. (You sure it isn't you that's being brainwashed, Willy?) But I can't get over the hump where I'm suppose to feel bad for someone who without the royal bank is worth $60 million dollars with continuous opportunity. ""am I spending too much on this house"" or ""do I need this extra room"" I mean....really? Your country is expensive, people can barely afford to live, most people have struggled throughout the pandemic...The tabloids are awful. And I'm glad where I'm not a part of a family or in a country where I have to make continuous deals with the tabloids. But I think the better question after reading this book is....does the monarchy even work anymore? Given that people's mental health and general well-being get put on the line like this all the time? (I can't see my own grandmother without making an appt. *Rolling my eyes*)"
Marie,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eye Opener,"Definitely an excellent read. I’m happy Prince Harry was able to finally write his story. Or, at least part of it. I’m sure there is so much more he is not able to tell."
chet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much to my surprise I loved this book,"I have watched, appalled, the treatment of Meghan in the tabloids. Until I read this book, I had not realised how bad it was. I am not at all surprised they have left the country, only that they stuck it out for as long as they did. While the British press constantly builds people up in order to orchestrate a later fall from grace, the sheer vitriol that has been applied to Meghan is unprecedented.The preceding paragraph may make it seem the book is all doom and gloom. It is most decidedly not. Prince Harry loves Africa, its people and its flora and fauna. Moreover, he works actively to improve things there, taking on charities others might consider hopeless. He loves the British countryside too. He loves his family and grieves the loss of his earlier close relationship with his brother and others. He served with honour in the army. He clearly wished to fulfil his Royal role.The book makes it quite clear that not only the Royal family, but also much of the British aristocracy is highly dysfunctional. I am not even sure that Harry yet realises quite how bad it is. The lack of the physical expression of affection is, in this day and age, bizarre. If even half of what he says about the infighting in the palace is true, many officials have no business being in positions of influence.As in only human nature, some of the stuff written may have been given a positive spin in Harry's direction. However, much of it, particularly about the press, has been proven to be true or is manifestly true and most of it has the ring of truth.On one point I am absolutely convinced. Harry and his family need security. Both the palace and the British government must be aware of the threats to their safety, which include a racist element and now, given the out-of-context quotes  from this book in the press, an Islamic extremist element too. If we can provide security to Salman Rushdie (as was the right thing to do), then why not the Sussex family? If anything happens to any of them, there will be hell to pay.It's important to realise the proceeds from the book are going to charity.Finally, it's an absorbing read. I heartily recommend it."
Peg Cooper,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sadness,Shame on the royal family for treating one of there own so badly. Family is supposed to have your back. If this is what being royal means I'm glad I'm not! Harry be glad you escaped.

J Ussher,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a Spare, he’s Rare","Astounding gut level story of this man’s life and experiences. I have such admiration for him as a husband, father, son, brother, family member and warrior, roles that are so important to him. His acknowledgement of the trauma injuries he has experienced and using therapy to work on them will undoubtedly give others hope. As a mental health professional, I applaud his amazing selflessness to share his story and thank him for his service."

Karen O'Connor,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read.,"This book provides an extraordinary look into the life of a Royal who was, indeed, always a spare.  Just look at the homes other royals got upon their marriage."
Darlene B. Thielman,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much more than I expected!,"This book has so little to do with all the tell all claims! It's about grief.

Becky,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enlightening Read,Very much enjoyed reading how Harry viewed his mother's death and life in the royal family. Was nice to read his personal view and not  a statement put out by the firm. Well done.
CAG129,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Real EYE OPENER,I really enjoyed this book. Harry expressed his feelings about the protocols he had to meet as British Royalty. The press was terrible but nothing was done. He and Meghan made the right choice.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly readable,"Bought on a whim, after reading about the charitable gifts from proceeds, surprisingly readable, and probably achieved what I assume was a motivation for writing it, of putting paid to any more medial hacks publishing recycling unattributed insider gossip to make money out of this kids misery."

I started reading immediately and you can feel Prince Harry’s heart in this book.  I love that he is telling his own story and people can hear his words from his mouth.  His mother Princess Diana was an amazing woman and you can tell he loved her immensely. He is his mother’s son.  Great book Harry.
K. L. Seward,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must read,A compelling telling of a young boy who loses his beloved mum. A woman beloved by the world. Perhaps the one person who truly loved him until Meghan. I’ve only just started but it so compelling I cannot put it down.

Plus, I would rather read about Harry through his own words, rather than the out-of-context clips from others. I recommend it!!!!"
Chris,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,so sad,I read the book because I wanted to read the source without the spin and misrepresentation provided by the media. It’s clear that Harry has suffered hugely from the trauma of his mother’s untimely death and the vicious attacks on him and his family. I think this publication is brave and I would hope cathartic but I also think it will feed the ‘beast’ and I hope he and his family can now look to the future and concentrate on their charitable works.  Enough is enough.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thoughtful and well-written.,This was a carefully and beautifully written personal account of his story. It was refreshing to read his take on his life and see him take ownership of his story.
Karen,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Karen,Really enjoyed this book.  It started the morning after the death of this mother and ended with the death of his grandmother.  Lots of sadness and joy.  A must read.

Kindle Customer  Linda Marie Durst,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, so much more than I expected.",I love reading about his Mother and agreed with his feelings for his father and brother.

LISA VANROSSUM,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,Prince Harry's words about his Mum.  So relatable.  I lost my Mom at age 6 to cancer.  It was like reading words of a kindred spirit.
LR.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent read.,"It's refreshing to see Harry finally narrate his own life experiences.I am not a fan of any so called royalty amongst humans. It divides us. I believe we are all born equal.Harry's wit and honesty makes him.I would have hated his life in a fish bowl, being judged by the hypocrites, being censored and controlled. A fancy prison.I hope he writes a sequel.Best of luck to him and his.I always thought he was the only honest one.He's escaped the royal fishbowl and is swimming in the ocean, at last.Admirable.ABOLISH THE MONARCHY!!We are equal."
Bunny,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great read!,"This gives an in-depth look at the dysfunctional royal family of Briton.  The slanderous press and the sibling rivalry of William toward Harry was unconscionable as was the jealousy of Camilla toward Megan and Harry.  I will recommend this to my friends.  Thank you Harry for a rare insight to royal life.  All best wishes to you, Megan, Archie and Lilibet."
G070,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Honorable Man's Life,"This is a book about,family,truth ,and love. I admire how in telling his story he is honest about his healing journey. Happy he found his person.Happy his wife found her person."
AmaGoose,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a gift!,"Even the recent news coverage of “Spare” was full of ridiculousness. When read in context, it all makes sense. A beautiful memoir. A shameful story of tabloid greed and family pettiness. Best wishes to the Sussexes."
Bookworm,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a wonderful story,"I have always had a lot of respect and admiration for Prince Harry but after reading his story I absolutely adore him.

Cynthia B,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Heir and the spare,"It was heart breaking to read, ""now you've given me an Heir and a Spare my work is done"" jokingly.

susan,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking yet hopeful !,"Beautifully written and heartbreakingly sad ! All of these years I’ve believed the press narrative of two brothers joined at the hip but this clearly wasn’t the case ! With leaks in the press I wondered if there was anything more to learn and doubted buying this but I’m so glad I did as the context , feelings and Harry’s thoughts aren’t conveyed via the leaks but are so poignantly made clear in the book . The book portrays a cruel, cold,  hierarchical system . I’m so pleased Harry left and has a family of his own where he is valued in his own right . The imagery and feelings portrayed in the book will stay with me forever . Harry is to be commended and praised for his bravery and courage in being so open and telling HIS story !"
Bzt,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW,The most interesting memoir directly from the source. What a wonderfully written stunning book. I can imagine Diana being proud of Harry for completing what she started-completely exposing a most cruel and outdated Monarchy.
Debbie Tackett,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,wonderful read,"This book was so honest, Harry talked about his life since he was a child. And everything after and in between. I very much appreciated how candid he was."
B. Na,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unfiltered and Raw,"I thought I’d heard enough about the Royal nonsense from the headlines, but saw Harry on Colbert and was really impressed and  intrigued by him. The book did not disappoint. An interesting read, there aren’t many examples of men that are willing to share their stories on such a raw level."
Victoria-Marie Whitlock,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and Eye Opening,"He wrote it honestly from the heart. He didn’t go out of his way to make others look bad, he just spoke the truth of what happened. Sweet and sad moments."

Meinir Thomas,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t believe what the media say!,"A brilliant book. Very well written. Nothing at all like the media has been making out. It’s a very enjoyable read, although heartbreaking, as the Prince’s grief following the loss of his mother is clear to see throughout the book, and it’s brought back memories of my own mother, who I lost around the same time as Princes William and Harry at around the same age, so I was comparing experiences and feelings a lot while reading it. I recommended people read this book - they’ll be surprised. Not that I actually believed what the media said anyway, I was sceptical about what they were saying, but I didn’t think it would be this far away from what they said either. A very interesting insight into his life. 5 stars."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great read,It was an interesting insight into the behind the workings of the royal family!  It's hard to believe that the press had so much power to spread the stories they are able to do.I think everyone should read this to understand what goes on in the monarchy.
kimberfunny,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unexpected,I loved it. I did skim over some of the war stuff tho. Deeply thoughtful and for a family we thought we knew so much about it was a relief really to learn more.
Shelby Parkison,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating,Really enjoying the book so far. I have a hard time putting it down once I pick it up. I love the insight on Harry's life and his experiences in his own words.

Sunsweet ,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful,"I was surprised at how well written this book is. Definitely more than just the “sensational” headlines. It’s his life, and it’s great to have such a clear perspective of his journey to peace."
Patty Terry,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A genuine voice about one man's journey,"Like too many others, I expected Harry to express self-pity.

Safi Sana,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really well written,"I enjoyed hearing and reading Prince Harry's story in his own words. The book was well structured and beautifully written. I think it captured his voice and his essence in a believable way. Through it shines his deep love for his family. In answer to the accusations of airing dirty laundry I would say that sometimes the need for truth is more important. We are to ""speak the truth in love"" (Eph. 4:6) and remember that ""Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful."" (Prov. 27:6). I think this book accomplishes these."
Dianne Riley,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Spare to me!,I very much enjoyed reading Harry’s book.. Agree with him it not to me the book is exceedingly honest. Many families have similar dynamics!
Ronnie169,Reviewed in Australia on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Real Life, ""reality"" Read","What an interesting read. Coming from the man's own mouth, the words just cannot describe enough of his life and lack of care during Prince Harry's upbringing. To be told ""you are the spare"" over and over has to give one doubts as to why they are here on this Earth. Were you wanted? Were you loved for who you are? Sadly though, this book shows that Harry is still suffering the loss of his mother, a grief he has not yet recovered from. Seems he still has to admit to himself that Diana, his mother, is dead. A great insight into British Royal life and their expectations, to which in today's world are so outdated and need to be overhauled."

Book focus a-lot on military, childhood trauma of loosing his mother and ended with focus on his wife Megan and kids."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honesty,You can tell theses are Prince Harry's own words. His own pain.  This is not the made up trash from the press or the royal story tellers.  He is his Mothers Son.
Jan S,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Interesting Read and Beautifully Written and Narrated,"I cannot put this book down, Prince Harry tells his story in his words and how eloquently he does it. Don't listen to all the negativity surrounding it, as usual the media are nit picking over bits and taking them out of context because it really does show them in a bad light and quite rightly so. He has had nasty things written about him and his wife for so long it's only right that he should now tell 'his story' himself. I also have the Audible download and it is an absolute joy to listen to Harry reading this book, he is a great narrator too! Well done Harry!"
lovejewels,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Book,This is a well written book by Prince Harry. Discusses his childhood and the aftermath of his mother’s death. He speaks very kindly of his father King Charles III. He goes into great detail about his summer travels and his love for Africa. A must read!
C L H ,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,It would be good if it wasn’t full of jealousy and whinging.,"Well….the hype was massive and this book was a massive let down. Prince Harry comes across as very jealous and bitter human being that still hasn’t dealt with the tragic death of his mother. Considering the ghostwriter is Pulitzer Prized it’s really badly written, flowery, almost childlike in some chapters. He says it’s “his truth” but is it “the truth”?"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly heartbreaking,I believe every word.  It's sad that family would choose power and money over family love.  Yet I hope one day things are resolved.
Avery ,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sharing is caring,"I’m so happy Harry was brave enough to share his story. I laughed and cried and felt all the emotions in between. Well written, moving and insightful - I highly recommend this book!"
GDuran,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and open,"



                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Honest, clear, poignant, and evoking a deep love. Prince Harry, has clearly cultivated a well written book. Sometimes stepping back and taking in the full scope of your life is required to make you see clearly. I found it to be engaging, heartfelt, funny and full of light. He’s doing his own work (on himself and in life) to be independent, clear his heart and mind & set his own path. Despite what he and his own little family has endured, the deep love that resides there about his brother & family is well exchanged. It’s almost as if I’ve read his diary - pure of thoughts, insights and clarity. Everyone deserves happiness, support & to be acknowledged. I came away, after reading this, with understanding and empathy. Living a life in privilege doesn’t always exclude us from pain. I hope and pray he continues to heal. Both within the walls of his thoughts and that of his relationship to his family. A well written journey."
Anna Weidling ,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His story his way,I have so loved reading from Harry his life story.  He is a human being dealing with grief while relentless cameras and judgment has been pointed at him.

Jemma Downs,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking,"Finally finished reading this book, and what a book it is. Felt like I was reading his diary in places. But so lovely to read HIS story in HIS words,in places so heartbreaking well tbh in many places to feel his pain in words, and his fun times that only he and his friends knew about, to his struggles.To read his book and then to see the media twisting what he wrote in his book truly does make you see what vultures they are. To read his love and protection for his wife 'beautiful' ❤️ So beautifully written."
K. Sadorf,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,wow,"Harry did a magnificent job sharing himself. I’m embarrassed that I read the articles and thought I knew the royals. In truth, Haz is the only one worth knowing."

Debra,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshing and unexpected,"This book surprises me in so many ways - I did not expect to be so captivated nor for it to be so well written and engaging.An honest and open telling if a boy growing up within a rather different family - but one he clearly loves- this book is so much more than the sensationalist headlines shared in press.Giving a historic insight into life in one of the worlds most famous families it’s just the story of a young man’s journey - you can’t fail to be moved by how lonely and isolated life was for him as a child and as a man, the challenges the press brought him and be glad for him when he finds happiness and himself.  And even though there’s some awareness, horrified at the tactics and cruelty of the press.A little unexpected in its quality, in fact a very enjoyable read and a bit of an insight into the reality behind the scenes."

Extremely funny in many parts and so so sad in others I never knew how many losses in his life there were such as his best friend and Caroline Flack.  Think many people can relate to the title of Spare as younger siblings and great to finally see a royal being so open and honest and relateable."

Not the “thicko” he was made out to be.Interesting to hear about his army career.Always liked Harry, and also Meghan. Never understood the hate for her. Was never quite believable.Glad to read his (fair and believable) side of the story rather than the heavily biased, fickle, skewed, abusive tabloid accounts that have made money off them both these past few years with their clickbait headlines.Yeah he’s privileged but meh, aren’t all the royals. I don’t think he’s the turncoat the media tried to portray him as. You can only poke someone so much before you get a reaction."

Bleuteardp,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just WOW!!!! Nonstop read literally,I'm not a Royal family follower however I've noticed since Harry's wedding to Meghan and months prior the level of negative comparison and harassment they were receiving from....tabloids. The in your face racism after their wedding and during her pregnancy....I had to read his truth.I read this book in 2 days.
Ana Marija (LadyFel),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and powerful,"It's rare that we get to read a book about a specific phenomenon - in this case the British tabloid press - while seeing it play out in real-time. The level of distortion that has gone on over the past few weeks in regards to snippets from this very book is, in a word, breathtaking. In another, despicable. Every last article published in the last ten days proves Harry's truth, the tabloid agenda and his family's silence signals collusion, fear and betrayal.Harry's memoir is an easy read, and contains significantly more love and understanding for this family and their relationship with said tabloids than they will ever know or understand. From the humorous anecdotes to the affectionate descriptions of games they used to play and rare peaceful moments away from the public eye, to the obvious omissions the palace was so worried about they breathed a sigh of relief when they weren't in there, he really doesn't tell us much that we haven't already heard - he's simply telling his own version of events. No wonder they're panicking, this man's showing by example how broken the press system is.Yes, there are some inconsistencies, because memory is inconsistent at best, let alone when you've gone through the loss of a parent at such a young age - if ""recollections may vary"" is an acceptable response from the palace, we should be extending the same grace to this memoir.There are some obvious cringy moments, which should serve to remind us none of us has gone through life without them, and as a hardcore disliker of all things phychic and mystical I found those few instances a little off-putting, but I understand why he needed that crutch and they didn't take away from the overall narrative - this is a warts and all accounting of his highs and lows and a very personal reckoning with himself and the media.It was about bloody time he spoke out. Kudos to the ghostwriter and to Harry himself. I say read it and make up your mind from there."

He is still a human being and deserves respect as does Meghan.  We can all agree to disagree but his feelings and experiences are his alone.  We have not stood in his shoes and have no right to judge.  Kudos to you Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex .  Anyone who has experienced trauma and been through therapy will empathize and respect his courage to speak up finally and release .  Memories can get mixed up as we all have experienced so I can take that into account , so should you (the reader).  Shame on the Press for hounding and hounding ."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very enjoyable and in some instances very relatable.,"I have always liked Harry's public image.

Robin,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant book by a courageous young man.,"Yesterday I read over 200 pages of this extraordinary book, Spare, which grabbed my attention and kept me interested throughout – a really fascinating read. Based on what I have read so far, I would say that Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is a genuine Prince of England, just as his mother was a genuine Princess – the real thing.In particular, his detailed history of his ten years in the British Army reads like a thriller, and I was seriously impressed with how much this gallant young man has achieved in his early life to date.Apart from anything else, this book is a remarkable event in British history. Never before has there been such a candid personal account from a contemporary member of the royal family – quite unprecedented. The book is clearly destined to become an English classic.One of the things that most interested me is that Harry is both respectful and affectionate towards his father, now King Charles – whom he refers to as Pa. It actually improved my opinion of Charles, rather than the reverse. On the other hand, he reserves his most bitter criticisms for his older brother, the Heir, whom he refers to throughout as Willy. For some reason, not as yet explained, his brother always calls him Harold. He also criticises Camilla, whom he accuses of briefing against him to the press.After reading about half the book so far, I am constantly reminded of another Prince Harry, Shakespeare’s Henry V, one of the greatest of our English kings. He displays the same heroic courage and strength.The royal family has made a terrible mistake, just as with Diana, in alienating this formidable character who, it would seem, has gone on to find true love and lasting happiness. God bless him, Meghan and their children."
Anna,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to Put Down,"I was excited when I initially learned that he would be releasing a book. I was really aghast to learn the media's betrayal, and their utter lack of empathy; as well as how no one was ever truly there for him. I was already a fan of Prince Harry and Meghan, but now even more so."

I can not recommend the audio book for this one enough. I think hearing Harry’s inflections makes it feel as though he’s telling you his story. You get the jokes, sadness, giddiness, anger."

fiona fog,Reviewed in Australia on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredibly Moving,"Phenomenal, moving and unforgettable. Harry and Meghans story resonated with me personally, the lies, attacks they endured was devastating. And to know that family was behind it, and they stood back and did nothing astounded me.I’ve seen the outcry in regards to this book, the taunts, disbelief that Harry had revealed secrets surrounding the monarchy, and he’s a disgrace. The people crying the loudest are the ones who did this to them. The media, the royal family and the people behind the scenes should be held accountable.I have always been a staunch supporter of both Meghan and Harry, I think the love they found with other is beautiful, soulful and forever."

Anne Desgroiselle BARBARIN,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,interesting book,Even in Princess Diana's time I was never fooled by the criticism made by the press which hunted her. ( she hides but she likes it !) the same is true for Harry ( the Heir is respected at least) and even more for his wife ( watch Netflix). I feel a lot of compassion and respect for them. This book is well written and lifely. I feel sick when I hear the criticisms they are so mean and  so biaised . Read this book and please made your own judgement !

Tewfiks88,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Taking control over the narrative of one’s own life,"One reviewer before me wrote that “no one wins here”- but this book isn’t about winning or losing. It’s also not what you should read for “the truth”- this is HARRY’s truth and his story of what happened through his own lens and that of his wife. After living almost 40 years with his story told for him I don’t blame the prince for wanting to speak his truth and take some ownership over the narrative of his life and that of his immediate family, like his wife. If you’re going to read this book to determine who is right and who is wrong then skip it- it’s annoying to see reviews across different websites arguing about stuff like that. This is one persons remarkable story told from his point of view, and it is honest and brave and very well written. I loved it."

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is is how a celebrity memoir should be written! Whether you love or hate Prince Harry, there was some parts where I was literally gasping in shock at things he was writing. I want to be doing that for every famous person’s memoir.Objectively, the writing was fantastic. His ghostwriter did an amazing job."
Matthew Barker,Reviewed in Australia on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much more!,"We’ve all heard people talking about the few sensational bits about Harry’s family, but there is so much more in his autobiography about his life, his work, his mother, his career in the army, and his new life and family. I highly recommend this book.  Read it for yourself and learn what his life has really been like.  It’s a deeply moving read, with great insight, humility and humour. And if you think Harry has just pointed his finger at others and laid the blame at their feet, be prepared to find he actually owns his mistakes too."

A true Watershed Moment for the Nation. Hasn't exactly been treated fairly in his life I've come to understand.

Shannon ,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Picked it up and couldn’t put it down!,"Well written, insightful, and worth the read. Don’t be mislead by the press snippets.  Harry is believable in the telling of his story."

s moon,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Read,Harry finally told his side and it was a very heart warming account of his life.  Never once did I feel that he threw anyone under the bus like the media reported.

Sheila ,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Read,I usually do not buy books like this but l was curious. I really like it so far!
Serenity,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! What we were told by tabloids are all lies!,"This is an absolutely lovely book. It is nothing like what the tablets and all the press frantically told us it was before it came out.  😂😂. It’s very moving and a really sweet and lovely tribute to the Royal family including King Charles, the late Queen, Prince Philip, and even Prince William.  Sure there’s some sensitive issues and arguments touched upon but it’s definitely not any type of attack on the Royal family even the Queen Consort is dealt with honestly but gingerly.  He doesn’t sugarcoat things but he doesn’t attack either.  much of what is included is already in the public sphere having been printed in the press or other people writing books about it this is simply his own perspective, and often fragmented memories.  It’s beautifully written.  I highly recommend it."
Rachel,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Problems of the Rich are still... Problems,"Good on you, Harry; people don't do this sort of thng unless they have to. I believe he'd loved to have resolved this otherwise."

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,An interesting and amazing read.  Loved the frankness and the introspection.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it.
Mr Penguin,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The evil courtiers!,I guess it’s healthy for a prince not to be treated with universal deference but I was staggered by the casual disregard and even contempt that courtiers showed to Harry without fear of rebuke. It can be nothing other than miserable to live through such a depressing difference between reality and appearance. The people closest to the senior royals seem shamefully weak. Some pretty big unanswered questions too about how the sandringham agreement was torn up (‘ask Granny!’ was a bit ominous). Totally fascinating.
Jamie  B,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great read, well written.",Best of luck Harry. I hope you and Meg find the life you both want and deserve. Thanks for sharing your story. Good job!

Luke Wickens,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,An insight into the truth about UK tabloids,"This autobiography provided a good insight on the lack of ethics in the UK’s tabloid press and the complex web between the press and the royal offices.It was interesting to learn about his time growing up as a teenager, in Africa and in the army. There were laugh out loud moments, solitary moments and times when I couldn’t put the book down.After learning about the challenges his wife faced (to put it mildly), I truly hope they find some peace"

Anna,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"His story, his words, his context","I bought this to read Harry's story in his own words, in the context he intended it to be read, not via the shameful manipulations of the British press. I also bought a Netflix subscription just for December, for the same reason. Needless to say, the media's version of the book and series have no resemblance to the actual book and series.I found the book raw, emotional, interesting and believable. The media is notoriously cruel to their chosen prey, and their relationship with the royals and the 'men in grey suits' has been known for years.I'm so glad Harry has finally found peace and happiness with Meghan, Archie and Lili. If anyone deserves it, he does."
Angella,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent!!,Who cares about fact checking. This is truth. The truth of an inward journey The truth of memory! Well done Prince Harry

Andrew Smith,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A terrifying insight into the methods of the British media,"I am not a ""royalist"", I have little to no interest in the Royal family. I have however always been amazed at the British tabloid media and how effectively they can manipulate public opinion.Harry rightly attacks the British media throughout, and it comes as no surprise that the same media is now successfully convincing the population that this book is nonsense and that they only want attention.Buy it and form your own opinion, the British tabloid media is a disgrace, it can't be trusted. If they don't want to reading stuff like this, just ask yourself why."

hamera,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book. Incorrectly reported in the media,Well written and easy read . You can see why he hates the media so much but also needs to expect that when you are in the royal family they will report any instances of racism and it’s hardly fair to suggest they shouldn’t . If a young guy can hold so much bias what can you expect form the older members . Also not sure he should be disclosing so much about the army . He’s too honest but I like it .

Mrs. Stevie C. Reece,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry your extremely resilient - ignore the weirdos,"Harry is one for hose people that everyone will criticise. Journalists and the media make me sick. The whole world is bullying someone for talking about his life as he sees and feels it. Every one wants to criminalise his words and tell him what a bad person he is. It’s terrible. We all have a story and it seems no matter what Harry does, someone’s there to knock him down. And for what reason? Nobody even knows him, only the people involved in his life know him. A bunch of media and a bunch of strangers putting someone down that they don’t even know! We have some sad people in this world that project their negativity on to others. This book is Harry’s story, like it or lump it. You can’t change someone’s life story. He is entitled to say whatever the hell he likes because …… it’s HIS book!!!! Media and journalists are disgusting. Harry ….. keep being you, keep going."
M. Langston,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the Truth,"This is a fantastic, honest and vulnerable telling by Prince Harry.  I’m so grateful that he has written this book! Why should the public be deceived by the British Royal Family any longer?"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Media frenzy,"I was born the same year as the late Diana, the Princess of Wales and apparently shared some of her favourites - the music, the taste in perfumes, the love of truth, the need for freedom of expression...the love of children, her own and other. In her years as Princess Di, the media hounded her, celebrated her, made her look like a misfit, assigned blame, raised her on a pedestal, then slowly but surely directed her death, knowing full well her desire for an ounce of privacy that she so deserved after all she gave of herself. Deja vu.Here is her boy, who was raised in a guilded cage (but never afforded a proper treatment or therapy,  shipped off to boarding schools and various homes which were always empty of what he sought most - unconditional love of a parent), currently subjected to yet another media feeding frenzy because he disclosed too much. Of what? Of his own soul searching journey? Who cares what impression his book leaves about the Royal family, King Charles or the Institution? What is wrong with this world? People, that's what. Envy, greed, wrath, pride...should I go on? I am disgusted at the depth of human malice (media and anyone posting about Harry's betrayal) and I wish Harry and his family the best of luck in the future they carve for themselves, the one his mother wished for herself but was not permitted to enjoy. The twisted, cruel minds working their plots, the ignorant public taking the bait...nothing has changed, but there is hope. For those two lovely toddlers, for my unborn grandchild (not sure about the percentage of Blackness, but Grandma can't wait to hold you), for all the future generations because we cannot survive this malice as a species, climate change or not."
Anna Gonçalez ,Reviewed in Brazil on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Reality behind royal,"Harry tells us the truth about his family, privileged people who have privileged lives, posh manners and way of living, trying to makes us believe they are and wish to be people like us!

K. Scott,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing like the unfair media hype. Brilliant read.,"Could not put this book down. Brilliantly written, balanced memoir. At the end of the book you completely understand how much Harry loves his family and how much he had to escape “The Institution”. The book vs the media narrative illustrates perfectly what they have been trying to say. So sad that a majority of the British public choose to gobble up the lies instead. If you have an opinion on any of this, you must read the book."
Dot Main,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking,I found this a hard read but fascinating. You can tell Harry is tortured by his mother's death and not getting any support from his family . Expected to just have a stiff upper lip. I applaud him for taking his family away from it all because he knows what lay ahead for Archie and he didn't want that for his son or any other children of his and Meghan . You keep doing what your doing Harry ignore all the trolls .If you were my son I would be so so proud of you .

Adeniyi Adeoye,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great story written beautifully and Harry has finally owned his story,"If you want a tell all biography, this is THE ONE. Apart from the book being beautifully written and thrilling (read it all same day), what I like most about this book is the extent the Prince went to tell his truth. The good stuffs, the bad stuffs and the ugly ones are all beautifully conjoined in here and I think he has finally owned his narrative. The british tabloids would even be madder that Harry reveals dirts like his drug usage and how he lost his virginity. The Prince has left them with little or no dirt to write about him ever again."

S. M. Darling,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His truth rang true,"I am surprised by how many people I have heard, quote extracts from the book or seen as tabloid headlines in a critical way regarding Harry, as if he is telling falsehoods, or foolish for disclosing this or that and every single thing I’ve heard or read was completely out of context to how it was written. That in itself completely confirms what Harry is saying. There is nothing that he can do right according to some people. And the fact that the palace remained silent regarding the vile and abusive words of Jeremy Clarkson towards his wife yet act on other issues confirms his side of the issue also. In the book he comes across as a deep thinking man who realised what changes he needed to make and he really examines his background. This is not just his past but his life now and it is written very well. I like the book and I like the guy. I wish this book every success"

AvidReader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The press have taken this out of context as usual,It’s a lot to take in.  I’m halfway through and noticed the haters are out in force giving bad reviews bet they haven’t even read it.The ghost writer has done an amazing job and you can tell many hours have gone into this.Trauma is a very personal thing.  You can tell he has live for his brother and for his Pa.  It’s the press he hates and with very valid reason.  Would suggest this as a very good and personal read and ignore the press taking things totally out of context just for clicks.Well done Harry for getting your voice out there and congrats on smashing world records

Yes, it most certainly was.  Can’t vouch for the accuracy of events described and personalities portrayed, but the yawning chasm between what is actually in the book and the vitriol poured on its contents by pundits in the media and on twitter tells you all you need to know about what Harry and Megan were up against."
Sarah Johnson,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a story of a life we didn't know about.,I really liked this book. You never know about what other people's lives are like. It's really very interesting .
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book,Well written and I think the truth of what really happened from the people it happened about and to. Loved it.
mrs c,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unflinchingly honest and sincere,"I didn’t know if I would enjoy reading this book after there were so many spoilers reported in the press ahead of the launch of the book!I have to admit that I was actually shocked by how compelling this book was to read! I literally couldn’t put it down!I understand that the book is written from Harry’s perspective and there is always a subjective element to any autobiography, but there seems to be unflinching honesty in this book with frequent references to how he could or should have done things differently and the impact of press intrusion in every element of his life!Don’t expect newspapers to promote this book, reading it myself I can see why they have gone hell for leather to discourage it! Interesting therefore to see the media spin on the contents of this book and what is actually written is almost a validation of the narrative.I won’t spill any details of the contents but I wholeheartedly recommend reading it!I wish Harry and his family every happiness in the future, they totally deserve it!"
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing and beautiful,"This is a beautiful and eloquent read. Heartbreaking in places. Astonishing and shocking in many. But heartwarming and emotional in others. Harry has a way with words.No person should be mistreated by their family and in-laws. The British press are unbelievable and though I am a fan of the couple and knew of the difficulties they face, this book really brings it home and shows the human story behind their fight to be treated as equals. Harry and Meghan and their children deserve all the happiness in the world."
Putarooni,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting insight,"Whether you like him or not, if you are going to read the stories in the papers or online, you should do yourself the favour of reading the actual book too. I am not going to give away any spoilers, but why be interested in something enough to read the news about it, but not the actual source? It’s the same as people who moan about the state of world politics, but never vote themselves. Don’t base your opinions on hearsay and snippets, read the book and make up your own mind."
Cliente Kindle,Reviewed in Brazil on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,More than tabloid headlines,"Despite the leaks and the deliberate effort from British media, I bought the book and boy... I loved it!"
Haley Voss,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Detailed and beautifully written!,"Although it’s getting a lot of coverage in the press, there’s plenty of details in the book that haven’t been talked about! Definitely worth a read!"
paul stephenson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific,I’m enjoying this book immensely. It’s immersive and interesting. In addition to a good read you get to learn how the press can easily deceive the public by quoting parts of this book out of context and then adding any number of twists to make it support their narrative. When you get a part that was ‘leaked’ you can make a real comparison with what’s actually written and the media’s reinterpretation. It’s then that you can see the situation for what it is. Truly worth reading if only for that element but a great read generally.

Heather Eeles,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deeply moving,"I don’t think I have ever read a non-fiction book that has affected me more than this one.  Many laugh out load moments and many more that made me cry.  Prince Harry be proud.  I haven’t bought or read a newspaper for decades but it has been difficult to ignore all the stories about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as you can’t watch the news without hearing something or other.  I would rather believe what I see or read from the mouths of Prince Harry or his beautiful wife, not from “sources close to”.  This book was a fascinating insight into Royal life but so so much more than that.  I hope there will be more books and documentaries to come."

Deborah Louise,Reviewed in Australia on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Moving Memoir,An amazing read. I was in boots and all from the first sentence. I have so much respect for Harry. Revealing his life in this book with love and at times raw emotion and honesty in his view of events and how they unfolded. Brave to share with the world of his childhood trauma regarding his Mother’s sudden death and how that trauma has shadowed and shaped his whole life. Bravo Harry…Diana would be so proud of the man you are now.
Victoria,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing.,"Such a thoughtful, introspective, and touching book. Such courage to dig deep, speak his truth, and self reflect. Brava! Your mother would definitely be proud."
Flyfisherjo,Reviewed in Canada on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,It can’t get more honest than this…,"Everyone will have an opinion on what a man who very few actually know has to say about growing up in a family like the royal family of the UK. Already the official media reviews are panning the book but they take much of what he says out of context. They portray childhood memories as adult thinking, etc. Typical media doing exactly what Sussex says they do.Keep in mind too, that these are his memories, which he admits are flawed, remembered by him and gathered and written by a ghost writer.It’s a good look into the family which has so carefully crafted its public image. He has nothing to lose, those that choose to malign him will continue to do so. Those who wish to hear his version of events now have the opportunity.The only flaw I might point out is when the writer (which could be Sussex, the ghost writer, or the editor) thinks for someone else. For example, as teens, Sussex tries to explain what he thinks Prince William might have been feeling. Without asking specifically, no one can know.It does reaffirm for me, as a citizen of a Commonwealth country, that perhaps it is time to retire the monarchy."

His honesty shines through and his character is shown through every heart-hitting, soul hurting and mind blowing humbleness words of loyalty about his family - his deep hurt and heartache that he experienced, and his joy at finding peace with his beautiful, strong and loving wife, Meghan. I applaud him and as a mother, I am sure his own courageous and loving mother will be so proud of the man her cherished son has become."

Nancy Payeur,Reviewed in Canada on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest & Thought-provoking Memoir,"After reading numerous short and annoying articles about Prince Harry’s memoir, I was determined to read the entire book.  And I’m glad I did.  Yes, there are shocking and sad revelations about the Royal family.  These have been the bits most touted in advance press coverage.  But none of the articles I’ve read have captured or even described what makes the book most absorbing.  This is the book of a man born into a strange role, one that is incredibly privileged as well as enormously restrictive, even claustrophobic.  It strikes me that Harry’s personality- his down to earth quality, enjoyment of action and his search for meaning in service - may be particularly unsuited to life within the monarchy, as it currently exists.  What I appreciated were Harry’s honest descriptions of his mistakes and struggles and his description of his time in the military.  He has struggled to come to terms with the loss of his mother - and the role of the “paps” in her death - and that has shaped him.  His sense of right and wrong is well honed and he is rightly outraged by the racist and unlawful  behaviour of the press towards himself and his wife Meghan, as well as the unhelpful silence and even sabotage of his own family.  This book is a coming of age story of a man who has shown the courage to make a new life for himself and who has faced his own weaknesses as well as those of his family.  It is at many points a sad story of failed relationships and loss of trust but there is also hope for a new beginning."

rob stirling,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to accept this is written by an army vet.,"Firstly I should say that at the same time as ordering 'Spare' I also bought 'Revenge' by Tom Bower and '.....And What Do You Do ?' by Norman Baker ----- for a bit of balance really.'Revenge' is the only one of the three that is accompanied with photos.'Spare' is the only one of the three that has no chapter contents and no index. Apart from anything else that is frustrating. We know that this is written by a 'ghost writer', but the flowery prose doesn't match the man as we know him. That does cast some doubt on the accuracy of much of the contents (as others have written, and as the media have reported).The whole thing comes over as a rant by a person obsessed with the media for its blunt attacks on his mother and for his now irrrevocable reliance on that same media for filming his life and indeed sitting back and dictating his (and no doubt Megan's) books.I am glad that I bought the other two books ----- they may also be rants from another viewpoint but at least I have balance."

Finally Harry has found his own voice and power. He has every right to tell his own story, and I am glad he did. bravo. and for the record, every time I will see a tabloid that says “a royal friend told us “ or a “Source says” Now I will be aware the family of dragons are on the attack!

Great to hear the other side and Harry seems so sincere and their gorgeous love for each other triumphs over the grubby press leaks. Read and learn Charles and Wills, of how love should be. They should be ashamed of themselves but maybe Charles and Wills are also products of their own upbringing  but thankfully, Harry had the guts to break away. Well written and humorous too, very interesting and never boring. Highly recommended."

You may just see for yourself the disgusting spin at play.The prose is so beautiful in places, so descriptive, that it transports the reader there with Harry.Symbolism is used throughout to great effect. Harry's contempt for the tabloid press is palpable and understandable. His frustration with his family likewise.Honest, heartbreaking, eye opening, enthralling and uplifting.

Flame,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sums up media bias perfectly,"This was an enjoyable read of 1 persons journey to where they are now. Regarding the media bias and absolute disregard they have for people, whether celebrity or  normal person, this book hits the nail on the head. The media cherry picked bits out the book for an online outrage and did so without the context involved but from reading the book it was clear to see exactly what points harry was putting across and actually gain an understanding of being brought up in an institution under media glare and how claustrophobic as to how that would feel.I am in no way a royalist, but well before this book was even published seen how the media onslaught began with Meghan and harry. Many years ago fergie, dianna and other members of the family endured a vicious media onslaught but by today's standards and with the social media it is absolutely diabolical how the uk media gets away with the virile they print, in order to sway the masses and make money. Watching certain middle class men media presenters sit smugly and slate Meghan and harry is beyond belief and reeks of obsessive tendencies of having to be right. In all honesty every family has dysfunction and dramas and royals are not above that dysfunction either, as they are just people same as everyone else. Harry definitely did the right thing for himself and his wife and children."

a reader Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good content.,Clears up much of the confusion. Oddly really gives a good review of Charles as a father.
Tina E,Reviewed in Canada on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a trashy take-down like the press would have you believe,"Unlike many reviews here, I have read/listened to the book in its entirety (I switched in between). I admittedly came in with preconceived notions of all the players, and Harry does a great job of humanizing everyone. Contrary to reports, it's not a trashy take-down. He's not making money gossiping about other people. It's his story, told by him. No one can say this autobiography isn't incredibly well-written, or that Harry isn't breathtakingly honest. I know some people have said he overshares, but with the exception of the detail in the story about his frost-bitten ""todger"", I didn't find he shared any more unnecessary juicy tidbits or overly-private details than other autobiographies I've read. In fact, I question if those who critique this aspect have ever read another autobiography.If I could, I would knock 1/2 star because he spoke in generalities a few times, whereas I think specifics are required given the claims he's making. His approach to Africa also had troubling, colonial undertones and I wish that was explored further. I'm rounding up to 5 stars (vs. down to 4) partly to offset all the troll 1-star reviews. But all-in-all I thought it was a terrific read/listen by a man with an unbelievable life to date.PS - there have been dozens of books written about Harry, by strangers. And thousands of articles in tabloids. Those strangers made money off telling false versions of his story. If you're more upset that Harry is making money off writing a book about his own life, than that hundreds made money writing lies about him, then I don't know what to tell you."

Frau Buddenbrook,Reviewed in Germany on 11 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well done,"Mir ist und bleibt die aktuelle Aufregung um dieses Buch schleierhaft. Selbstverständlich hat auch ein Prince Harry das Recht, all das, was jahrzehntelang über ihn durch die Klatschpresse gerezrrt wurde, nun aus seiner Sicht zu erzählen.  Völlig egal, ob und wieviel Geld er dafür kassiert und ob man seine Empfindungen nun  teilt oder nicht: Ihn dafür als Verräter, oder Nestbeschmutzer zu betiteln, finde ich lächerlich..."
Shirley,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written insightful memoir,"A well written, thought provoking and reflective account of his life and journey.

Kayzee,Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Spare No More,"I loved Harry’s book. Open, honest, a real eye opener into the world of the royals. I always thought the elder royals were cold and couldn’t show affection. This book really shows that they indeed can’t. Thank goodness Harry has found the love of his life and broken free from that toxic environment and his children won’t have to be a part of that family in any great sense. Harry, keep being free and happy surrounded by your own loving family and continue to grow on your own merit, strengths and beliefs. With all my love to you, Meghan, Archie and Lilibet."

schor,Reviewed in Canada on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprising (or not) how those tabloid stories turned out to be such non-stories,"This book is first and foremost a memoir about a little boy who didn't get the help he needed when his mother died, which put him down a path that was violent at times and found comfort in the army.  And throughout the book, he illustrates the many times that the paps and tabloids didn't help him as a young boy and, as we all know, were vicious/racist/misogynistic to him and his wife, and how his family never helped and, in fact, fed stories to the tabloids at times for their own popularity gain.  It's also a sad story about a fractured family who no longer trusts one another, who uses their royal supremacy against each other, constantly suspicious of what the others are up to.  It also goes into detail about how he attempted therapy several times and finding the right therapist has helped him come to terms about his mother's death.  I cried at parts, but really bawled at the end, which were the funerals.I want to add that Harry had many very positive interactions with his father and his brother, there were many tender moments especially when he was younger.  His father supported him whenever he made mistakes even as he grew older, understood what he was going through, may even have had some regrets about not getting Harry some help after his mum's death. And his relationship with his brother was also close and very brotherly, and they had disagreements like brothers do.  I wish the media would focus more on those tender moments that Harry talks about because there were many."

Jacqueline W.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Harry’s Truth,"To all the people who are against Harry and Meg, read this book with an open mind and you will come to realise what brought Harry to where he is. How could anybody fail to feel his pain. I for one am happy that for all his suffering he has found the love of his life and created a wonderful life for himself with Meg, Archie and Lily. Good luck to you all and my best wishes for the future."

T Somers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbelievable,  heartbreaking. One of the best I’ve ever read","I cannot believe what this country’s government, and royal family allowed the media to do to this beautiful couple, I’ve always loved Harry, and now absolutely adore Megan. She is an empath, a beautiful human and beautiful soul. From this book you get to see who runs this country and the dishonesty of those behind the scenes and also those in the limelight, shame on them. it’s an amazing insight to a life of a royal household."

pinkpanther,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems honest and direct,"Everyone‘s read much about this book, deemed so controversial. In the papers, quotes were taken out of context and the duke was strongly criticised for his accounts. Reading the book, I was really surprised how genuine and critical it came across. Yes some themes are weirdly repetitive and I‘d side with a therapist quoted in the book that he‘s entirely addicted to the media; not in a good way. However it‘s his journey on paper and the book - in my eyes - makes him look much better than he is credited for in the newspapers."

E. Sanders,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A story both heartwarming and heartbreaking,"A story of family, grief, searching, and ultimately love. A story you think you know but you don’t. A story worth reading."
Bag Lady,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,"If you’ve followed the subtext in the press, interviews with Harry and Megan and just used your rational mind, you’d see that there isn’t much new information in Harry’s book.One important thing it does though is to highlight how horribly the press, paparazzi, and general media have treated Megan. It is certainly a mystery why her new family, who seemingly accepted her, did not step up and support her.  It seems Harry tried, but as even he indicated, he was unprepared for what came.I don’t read the news bits or social streams about any of the royal family any longer because I agree with him, nothing that gets printed, is close to the truth.I hope that over time Harry and his family can enjoy a more secure life, but I expect Archie and Lilibet will have to contend with all these same issues.The book contains some interesting details about Harry’s military service and his service work in Africa.  I believe that Megan was indeed Harry’s person, and that she deserves a lot of encouragement and cudoes for putting up with the horrific way she has been abused by the press, the Royal family and especially Piers Morgan (who should be censured for his vile comments).Certainly this family has earned some time out of the spotlight and I wish them well."

This book is wonderful. Take no notice of all the negative reviews, they probably haven’t even read the book. Great book. Love it. The British tabloids are a mendacious toxic organisation who only care about selling their gutter rags and don’t even have a nodding acquaintance with the truth. Ignore the bs media and read this book instead. It’s a great read and very emotional and heartfelt."

Emily A.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ignore the tabloids and their clickbait. Hear/read it directly from him!,"Ignore the tabloids. Ignore the sensationalised headlines and clickbait. Hear/read it directly from him.He doesn’t attempt to paint himself as innocent, nor does he bash everything in his path as the tabloids have painted it. It shows what lies behind the curtain: a highly dysfunctional family with certain people who are toxic. It’s very relatable in many aspects for those of us who live in similar situations.He shows that childhood trauma isn’t something you can escape from just because you’re rich or have been shipped off to a boarding school. Trauma will always be there, and it doesn’t take much for certain things to bring it back to the surface. It’s an incredibly raw telling of his story and his life and how it, at times, parallels with what he and his wife are going through.The serious things aside, he also shares a variety of stories and memories that bring out a laugh and clearly shows love."

tracy,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Expected more,Wasn't sure what to expect in this memoir. It is very believable of the life he led living in that royal bubble and not being able to live normally. It is a shame that his marriage broke things apart and created so most unnecessary drama. Who knows the real story? His or theirs? Of course a husband is going to defend any action of his wife and maybe not see clearly her actions or intentions. You cannot discount his own families feelings and perspectives. However I do not believe the Royal Family is innocent. How can a father cut off ties with his son? Jeopardize his and his families lives? I am saddened that the Queen wasn't more sympathetic and supportive but then again she denied her own sister her happiness. The family is a psychological mess and who  in their right mind would want to be a part if it. Diana was pursued endlessly and no one cared. I seriously believe that Meg wanted a fairy tale life as she jumped from one relationship to another and landed with the ultimate prize. Harry was so broken since the death if his mother that he desperately wanted someone to love and marry no matter who.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartbreaking but hopeful,This book is nothing like it has been portrayed in the press. From his happy early life to the tragic events of 1997 and his everything that followed. I can now understand why he wanted to get away from the British press. Im glad he has found peace and happiness and someone strong to share it with. I honestly think Megan saved him.

I’m glad he broke free and I’m glad hes found his soul mate and I’m glad he felt strong enough to write this. The RF didn’t break him they made him stronger. This is a very honest book imo and I expect it was cathartic to write it. You go Harry!

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't care what anybody says, I enjoyed it.","I read this book knowing all the opinions of certain tv presenters and royal reporters.  I have heard every opinion out there, mostly negative.  I saw the TV interview with Tom Bradbury prior to the book coming out and the hoo-haa that followed that.  I'm glad I read this book, I am a royalist and from my perspectives there are no bombshells, nothing that would damage the Monarchy and nothing scandalous.  It reads like any old autobiography.  Shame the press twisted words from this book and used them as a weapon to beat Harry,his wife and kids and the royal family.  All out of context, of course.  So if you don't mind reading biographies, give this a go.  I really enjoyed it."

His father tried but just didn’t have the ability to comfort and nurture. It’s very sad that Harry and William aren’t closer. Harry is a beautiful soul and has been greatly underestimated.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spare me the florid prose,"I must admit I just started reading this book, but from the start the amateur writing style detracts from the story. The book opens with Harry arriving first for a meeting with his brother and father in a garden at Frogmore that contains family crypts. On page 5 a sentence begins with, “Our feet almost on top of Wallis Simpson’s face, …”Just so much bad writing crammed into the first few pages, and I’m starting to regret wanting to read this 407 page autobiography. I want to quote other bits of florid prose and sentence fragments used to bad effect, but that would mean posting the entire first five pages here.And when I turned to the end to check the page count, well, let’s just say at least the writing style is consistent.I can’t yet tell if this was written by a man who cannot write well, or a ghostwriter who is better suited to another genre or who perhaps is simply not a good ghostwriter.I turned the page slowly, the weight of my commitment to this florid tome weighing upon my shoulders as if it were a 407 page book, freshly printed and laden with the unfulfilled promise of a good read."

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Chilling.,"I don't know what I was expecting from this book, other than I once met Prince Harry and I liked him. What I wasn't expecting was the onset of some old PTSD symptoms.I don't mean that flippantly, especially in light of Harry's military service, but I once experienced a work environment so vile, so toxic, that I ended up wishing I could crash my car into a tree on the way to work.Something about Harry's account of life as a Royal stirred up those feelings of dread and anxiety. How many times was I summoned, without any courtesy, to a meeting where I'd sit friendless, unrepresented, while colleagues threw me under consecutive buses?Except, I had my family. Harry's toxic work environment included his family. Until he met his wife, he had no other support in this crazy, poisonous, dysfunctional institution, and then they went for her, too. And he couldn't just go and find another job, like the rest of us. There's little wonder he describes feeling lost, and trapped, for much of his life.Harry blames the press for manipulating and poisoning the institution, but also crucially questions the core humanity of his family, too. 'If we can't defend each other, is that a real constitutional monarchy? Is that a real family?'At times, I wanted to scream. It was so much like a terrible workplace. The Queen's dresser, who was asked to release Meghan's chosen tiara for a dress rehearsal, and then refused until the last minute; a ridiculous, petty needle-pusher. The courtier with the conveniently broken photocopier. I've met all these people, but at least my family never dropped me in it.I'm glad he's happy. I'm glad he loves and protects his family. Good for him."

Jenny Mein,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautifully written,"This book is beautifully written by ghostwriter & Pulitzer prize winner, J.R. Moehringer but Prince Harry's passionate, honest, fiery & courageous voice is at the forefront. Unmistakable. Utterly riveting transporting us to enchanting scenes from Windsor, Balmoral Castle, Scotland to the wilds of Africa! It is also desperately sad and often painful to read because of what he and his wife, Meghan had gone through.  Almost no compassion and support at the highest levels, the hateful & relentless press intrusions, and distortions. After reading this book I feel very disillusioned. What a cruel and intolerant world we are living in today. Well done to Prince Harry, such a remarkable man and brave soldier for speaking out."

I hope he's very protected from all the judgemental people who fling nasty insults at him. The monarchy has to wake up, open up, stop back-stabbing and feeding spin to deflect attention from their own scandals. There's a lot more truths to come out; this is just the tip of the iceberg."

This is a must read that I hope leads to a real wake up for the press and their role in relaying what they interpret as news . May the Duke and Duchess find the peace and happiness they deserve. I have always been a supporter and this confirms my resolve.

It's a bit messy to read as this seems to be a troubled soul.Whilst  it starts as a 12 yr old reflecting things as they happen it moves on to Prince Phillip's death quickly and flits around.

Abagail Vanmerlin,Reviewed in Canada on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible! Best Biography I Know Of!,"I bought this book on Audible yesterday, and have since purchased a Kindle copy and hard copy as well. It is INCREDIBLE!I am not a “Royal watcher” or lover of tabloids. My jam is listening to non-fiction books on Audible and devouring the classics in paperback. I am a book lover through and through! I pre-ordered my Audible version (no I don’t work for them!) and I was excited to see it was narrated by Harry. First of all, his narration is beautiful, truly perfection. The story, all of it, well nothing short of a well deserved standing ovation, and not at all what I was expecting based upon the headlines in my news feed. Was this the same book?! The media is clearly not reviewing this book in the same way as every other book and seem to be grasping for these gossipy bits and this “narrative” that I didn’t feel was a plot point. Truth be told, I have compassion and a human understanding for all of them, the entire family. It is a riveting story filled with adventure and tender, honest moments that are captured perfectly. Heartfelt, classy and unbelievably down-to-earth, a relatable human experience from a world that few could ever truly relate to. It was breathtaking and worthy of praise and applause. Harry, for his part, was brilliant."

We don’t need you to pick apart every little detail to discredit what is essentially someone’s right to try and live in happiness despite what they were born into with no choice or freedom. Even if they did choose, it is the media that have no dignity, they are the spiteful, vitriolic trash. I wouldn’t pay for a tabloid but I paid for this book and I hope Harry uses all his money to live his best life in a big f to all the people that think they can play the public, including the institution. Be open, be honest but don’t play."

J. A.,Reviewed in Canada on 14 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Intriguing.,"It’s nothing new, and it’s uniquely different. Being in a royal family makes the normal events of life extraordinary, but in Harry’s case, it made him a hero as a soldier, an explorer, an activist, and a family man. I cringed at some aspects of his lack of maturity but I also admired him for his mental toughness amid many anxieties and fears and doubts. I also respected him for carrying on and not in ordinary ways. Traveling to the North Pole and the South Pole and his frequent trips to Botswana and seemingly everywhere else are what make the man stand out among men. This man has endured it all. He’s overcome so many obstacles and his words bring back images of his mother, along with the grief that’s not gone from my heart, either. It makes one realize how much the royals probably craved exactly what he did, which was affection. It makes one wonder too, how faced with unrelenting, sub-human press intrusion, affection would be withheld when it was most needed and could’ve eased not all, but so much unnecessary suffering. There are two sides to every situation and then there’s wisdom as the third and/or right side. What is a royalty that seldom, if ever, makes room for the right side? Loving the monarchy means embracing and trying to understand their rules, damaged and in need of repair as they are. Prince Harry brought that to light, finally."
S. Chalmers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant book! Ignore the media.,"Loved this book. Really personal and very well written! So glad he’s finally been able to do this and portray exactly what he’s had to put up with over the years. Ignore what the harmful, hateful media are saying and cropping/clipping.

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in Australia on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insightful,"Harry writes about his family with tenderness, frustration, joy and above all else love.This book gives a very insightful into the symbiotic world of British press and the Royal Family. The yellow press is worse than you think it is and for this family to live their lives in some semblance of normality they have to deal with these toerags. This kind of intrusion is completely beyond comprehension, completely insane!Harry by telling his story is immensely brave, the Murdoch press and the rest of the gutter press will see this as war. They have already proved Harry right by taking quotes out of context from the book, created outrage where none existed and to demonise Meghan in the worst possible light.This book is definitely worth a read, and offers many reflections on: childhood trauma, obsession, grief, self destructive behaviours, familial culture, society, loyalty and love."

It’s his side of the story, and I’m happy that he has had a chance to tell it in its naked honesty. The record has been set straight. I’m not a royalist in any way, but I was curious to understand the dynamics behind the obvious hatchet job created by the British press, and hope others might understand the cruelty and damage created by the greed for attention that motivates them."

Without providing spoilers, there are members of the royal family who appear to be calm and good-hearted, but who apparently have mean streaks. This book is an eye-opener, and will likely make you rethink your views on the monarchy. Highly recommend."

The press made millions with lies about him, why would he not make money himself telling the truth about himself! Well done Harry! One thing I appreciate about Harry and the book is that he was man enough to protect his family against all odds. Any other man would have been appraised for doing the same and any who wouldn’t would have been mocked! I also appreciated that Amazon managed to get the book to me on the same day it was released. Glad I preordered it!"
rydasamyffxuf,Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,WOO is me story,"Here is my two cents...  the book was poorly written.  It was rather boring and it is certainly hard to feel sorry for someone who has everything handed to them on a silver platter.  Part of life in the spotlight is the spotlight.  You were born into a royal family, stop complaining.  Were you treated poorly?  Maybe.  Were you hounded by the press?  Possibly.  What I read is that your family threw you under the bus, not the paps.  Stop complaining about the press and start blaming your family.  The one who got the raw end of the stick is Meghan Markel.  Although, it is hard to feel sorry for her too.  I would think that knowing you are marrying in to the royal family, you would know it's not gonna be a peaches and roses.  I do not believe that Meghan did know who you are.  The whole world knows who you are.  Get over it...move on and stop begging for money.  I wish I would have saved mine.  I am sure I need it more than your family."

Joellen H.,Reviewed in Canada on 19 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Trying to make sense of his life,"I rather like Harry and Meghan. I can understand why Harry needed to tell the story from his perspective after so many lies and so much senseless hatred. It must be crazy-making and put enormous strain on relationships. When people say he’s out of touch I think, “Well how could he not be, after such a dysfunctional and bizarre upbringing?” But now he’s trying to heal, trying to learn how to be a person. I like him for not shutting up and refusing to obey. Even if he’s imperfect and groping in the dark sometimes- who isn’t? I like his honesty about how the army conditions soldiers to dehumanize the “enemy”. Yes, the ancient colonial institutions are tainted. Yes it is madness and he is slowly realizing it. Not so thick after all. He is quite humble and self-deprecating, but he won the love of an intelligent and strong woman. I like Meghan. She doesn’t pretend to be less intelligent and strong than she is. How upsetting for racists and misogynists (as we have seen). Good luck to them both. May they lead peaceful and productive lives and keep learning."

Harry takes us through the key moments in his life and what emerges is a decent, funny, thoughtful man. He has more integrity in his frozen Todger, if I may say so, than the whole of the Royal Family together. Charles has a lot to answer for and William just seems to be a classic bully. They were right to leave the UK. Love wins."
Karin,Reviewed in Australia on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Riveting Sad Heroic,"Prince  Harry’s story is clear, precise, unrelenting and utterly, but sadly, believable. Who doesn’t know a toxic family, workplace, gym, dance club? If you do, you will recognise it all — the cruel critical remarks, the silent treatment, the lie and deny trick, the downplaying and generalising of your pain, the complete failure to nurture, care and support you in your traumatised state. The BEE, the WASP the FLY — all aptly named! If this is how they treat the son of a monarch, the brother of a monarch in waiting —a bullied son, brother, grandson — pray you never find yourself in the last boat with them. Read it and weep folks, this is a textbook study of how NOT to be a family from the so-called number one family in the Commonwealth. It is also a story of how putrid, puerile, delusional media barons are fuelling our hollow and rotting social order. It is vain pomposity to believe they can advance in this life while desecrating and destroying the lives of others. Take heed reader: you may be next."
Ettaariane,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great book. Hope he writes more.,I would recommend reading every word of this book.

Always said the Queen / King and heirs are just the clock face of royalty, the real powers are in the back rooms, secretly planning plotting. The saddest for Harry and Megan is the loss of his family, and the only life he has ever known. Megan, the loss of her father. I know in my heart Harry and his family will be OK. Hopefully in time there will be some healing between the brothers. Trusting his family again.. that’s another story."
mtnview,Reviewed in Canada on 15 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very well written.,"I can usually move on to the next book easily, this one will take some time to digest.  A very forthright book. I feel that I have been involved in the story, heard the gossip, and didn't know what to believe. The book makes me feel that I have met the man and listened to him, finally understood him.  Whatever you think you knew or believed, this book should challenge you.  I kept wishing I could read William's side, not to refute Harry's story but I believe there has been equal hurt done there by the family. The misunderstanding between the brothers is very likely a result of the manipulation of the institution. You couldn't pay me enough to be part of that circus. Whether or not you favor Harry telling his side, what should enrage you is the paps constantly converging on the royal family for their own gain, and the spin doctors lying to sell papers.  To have numerous greedy people fighting over getting the best most saleable photo of you and selling it to the highest bidder for their own gain and not caring about the safety and well-being of their subjects is unconscionable.  I wish Harry and Meghan a happy, safe, private life and an income to provide it."

BUT I literally saw a boy grow into a man as I read this book. Wow!I am so grateful we finally got to hear from Harry himself. Sections of our Press have done our country a HUGE disservice. I stopped buying those Newspapers years ago (Way before Oprah Interview). When I put the book down I was thankful I had made the right decision to stop buying those Newspapers years ago. What we had been led to believe and what was actually happening in his life was like literally light and day. No grey areas - Just a stark contrast from the reality.People who have gorged themselves on Newspapers, Books etc thinking they know Harry. Dear Lord! You don't. I URGE you to PLEASE READ this book.So proud of you Harry for the man you have become. God bless you, Meghan, Archie, Lilibet Diana and Doria"

Coalman44,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry,Having seen so many nasty comments on social media I think the people making them should read this book and understand the difficult and traumatic events he had to deal with. My own mother died very young so I see and know that pain. Newspapers are out to make money and will print any headline true or false to get people to give them cash. Haven't bought a newspaper for many years. Well done.

Emily,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartfelt, and a painful read - a very important book","I am only a third of the way through the book, but felt compelled to write a review in light of all of the negativity around its publication in the press, but also because it feels like such an important story to be told. It is beautifully written, and Harry's pain permeates its pages; I had never before thought of the harm of seemingly trivial stories around his progress at school or normal teenage exploits in the gutter press could have on a teenager (and perhaps our role as consumers digesting these stories). My heart goes out to him.The factual errors don't seem important (if a King long-ago was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather or uncle - or not - that's how Harry understood it at the time; ditto for whether there was a governor or a governor-general in Bermuda - that's what Harry heard or understood; and that's what's important in a memoir.) Does it alter the direction of the narrative?Whatever your thoughts on how he has gone about telling his story; it is clear that the fact that the palace fed negative stories about Harry and later his wife to the press, to detract from negative stories around other (more ""senior"") members of the family, has caused him immense pain. I think I would feel similarly hurt. It feels from the book that he's explored many other avenues of discussing this with his family, none have worked, and it feels fair that he should be able to tell his story in his own words.I wish him all the best - I hope that he finds a way to heal, and move forwards, and that this book has provided some catharsis."
Gabriela Brunesco 101,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heartbreaking, inspiring, breathtaking","



                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 This book is an emotional roller coaster. Who ever said a life of privilege was easy? I defy anyone not to cry by the end of this book. Losing his mother, dealing with power-hungry family members willing to sell him out..this guy is a survivor. I'm amazed he's not more damaged. Nice, crisp prose. Even some lighter moments. And honest. Always Honest."
EMILY,Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wonderful human being,"Huge congratulations to Harry on this amazing memoir. It’s extremely well-written, emotional from the start, and humble throughout. I am British, and find it shameful and embarrassing that so many British people choose trashy gossip over truth. They’re missing out on being able to see what a treasure Harry and his family are to the country. The UK could do with more people like him."

We all saw them portrayed in the media and we dealt with them as best we could. Hearing Harry's honest account of how it was from his perspective is incredibly interesting. A real insight into a world that we will never really see. I loved this book, it gripped me from start to finish. This is history, honestly related first hand by a major character. What an insight.

naturalmama,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Worthy Read,"Harry has been vilified for years, particularly since choosing his wife.

Harry and Megan are doing what any mother and father would do by removing themselves from a toxic situation and protecting their children as best they can. Looks like they have a wonderful life full of happiness and freedom ahead of them."

Edward Leszkiewicz,Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truth is Relative…,"Much coverage of the XBOX mistake has been made… As a boarding school boy from 8 to 18 I can empathise with Harry... Even though you were Royal Harry, we were all equals in Boarding School, and especially Preparatory School. It was 1997, his Mother (Diana) had just died… so let’s not make waves over the differences between the names of a games console manufacturer. After all the Sony PlayStation was around in 1997, and a wonderful gift for a 13 year old boy. Great story… sad and poignant memories of a Royal losing a wonderful Princess and Mother."

Surprisingly revealing and richly detailed, even on matters that could reflect badly upon the author. It’s all in here, for better or worse! Prince Harry was unafraid and authentic in this book. Equal parts poignant and humorous."

An intriguing look into the sickness of the tabloid media and their cruel lies.

jeanm,Reviewed in France on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very touching, a great book.","I approached this book with an open mind. I was not expecting to be as moved and touched as I was. This is a poignant book, full of emotions. It is hard to imagine these royal family dynamics but HRH is full of love to them all, contrary to what the shady british press is trying to say. His book is a love letter to his mom as well. But I understand the crazy despair the british tabloids and press are reacting to the book. I mean revealing all their lies, disgusting practices, and murderous techniques hits them at the core. No the british press is not worried abour the Royals, they are angry cause he calls them on all their lies and holds them responsible for a murder: his mom’s."
Freya,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His mothers son,Beautifully written book which is so very sad in parts.

Paola,Reviewed in Australia on 17 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Your own man, yet Diana's son. Much to be proud about.","I don't usually read 'royal' biographies, but this book presented a compelling story of courage in the face of a different adversity. And, it was easy to read. I took it as 'out there for public record' his version of events. This is a moving story, take away the bells and whistles, and this is just the story of a boy traumatized by the loss of his mother, with a family unable to meet his emotional needs in this critical time. Harry is his own man, good for him. And yet, his mother's son, tender, loving presence always there."

Many (who are not royals) would react the same way to threats to their family. This book is searingly honest and goes against the narrative still being produced in the mainstream news today. The words in this book have been twisted to suit certain things but I do hope the author keeps on fighting fleet street and that the daily fail for one gets nailed to the wall"

Well I guess it was in a way but it really gave insight and context. This informs the reader of Harry’s truth. A must read.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing read,"It's a really good read, it's written in such a way that you actually feel like your listening to someone who's having a friendly conversation with you. It's not written in a pompous way but instead you can almost hear harry saying it. Especially since watching some of interviews before the books release because the audio version of the book is all done by prince Harry himself.I'm over three quarters into the book after only three days and I feel although it's eye opening it's also not surprising because it's cleared up or reinforced  alot of what people in my family have suspected ever since princess Diana did her famous TV interview and highlighted the royal firm  and media issue.The details within this book are obviously at times very personal but only someone who's spent so many years seeing others write things about them ( which the person it's about sees no connection to the reality of their life) would be prepared to share their version into history in such detail.Highly recommend.  I truly hope he does another book in years to come about his charity work with veterans and his work in Africa etc."

kamilla flahiff,Reviewed in Canada on 18 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,conflicted thoughts…,"I just had to read this book after all the hype surrounding it and having been a follower of the monarchy for years. The writing was immaculate, his ghost writer sure did an excellent job of keeping me captivated.I really felt such empathy for Harry when he spoke about his mom and how he kept saying he thought she was hiding all these years. That really made me sad and truly felt for him and his trauma.The rest of the book, however, just screamed privilege left right and center. Was very hard to relate to him and feel bad for him when all he’s ever had was immense privilege and pretty much fed from a silver spoon. I don’t think at any point in this book did Harry take the blame for anything at all.Also, Megan not knowing who his mother was is ridiculous."

Apart from being an inside view of royal life by an insider, I’ve always viewed the press with suspicion sometime before Harry. This book confirms it. I wish them luck and for the press to give it a rest."

RS,Reviewed in Australia on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must-read!,"This book is a must-read. Ignore the headlines, they completely lack context, and also amplifies the power of the media, completely confirming the authors claims. It’s an easy read, but it’s not a royal “tell all”. It’s simply the authors story, love, mental health struggles, war and life. I highly recommend it, and can only hope that people read it before judging."

Jill Mcleish,Reviewed in Australia on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,couldn’t put it down,What a brilliant read ….. written from the heart. How your father ever allowed your security to be withdrawn astounds me. If you were mine I would have paid for it myself can’t believe how many times you went to your father and he brushed it off and leaked info to the press. I can understand your hurt. You don’t need a family like that .I think they thought if the stripped you off everything you would come crawling back and toe the line. But your a soldier who fought in a war and did what he had to do to keep his family safe..no they won’t like this book but neither will the British press  might hurt a few to bad to sad. Very well written

I felt so sad for young Harry, his mother’s death and the horrendous media scrum who made his life a misery. Jealousy and behaviour of the new so called prince of wales is very much in evidence.

BFaeDav,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refreshingly and depressingly honest,"I saw a news article saying nobody queued up to buy this book like expected and already knew it'd be #1 best seller on Amazon. Just like the book and the interviews say, the British media are constructing a false narrative. People queued. They just don't want us to think they did. I started reading at midnight. I have no strong feelings about the monarchy but I love authenticity. I love self awareness and personal responsibility. Harry has always been the Royal family member that I have had the biggest hopes for. His story has much heartbreak in but I'm glad he's on the way to his potential now. Can't imagine breaking the pattern of ancestral traumas on such a massive public stage with the hatred and vitriol of so many media fed people, often with their meals served up by the family. I don't know any of them, but if Harry was my son, I'd be very proud of him. The work he's done on himself and the honesty he's bringing is so important for all of us to do. If all of the ruling class did it we might be in a better world."
M. W. Butler,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moving and insightful.,"Ignore the media hype and allow Harry’s narrative to show you a glimpse of his world, his inner turmoil and experiences.Moving, interesting, sad and funny, but best of all: in his own words."

Evelyne Wrobbel,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,interesting but not revolutionary,"There has been a lot of press around the contents of this book so I will not go into details here.I enjoyed reading parts of it for what it is, a very personal reflection of a person who has always been very much in the spotlight. I can understand the desire to give his own perspective. The biography is well structured, a good narrator which made it interesting to read and much less pointed than the single quotes that are being widely discussed in the press. It also has some lengths which is why I did not read all of it but just scanned through it."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing like the media claims,"A heartfelt biography that kept me turning the pages.  It follows Prince Harry's emotional journey after his mum's death, the impact this has on his relationship with the tabloids, and the conflict the tabloids cause within the royal family."

But if you read this book and you still believe, still buy into the articles the press print. Then there truly is no hope for you. There are always two sides to a story, yes. But the press, some news reporters have peddle untruths about them. Have been allowed to get away with it. Why am I not surprised this is England (post Brexit) :0/"

Individuum Nr. 1,Reviewed in Germany on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning of the end for the Royals?,"This book is an awesome read. Finally Prince Harry can control the narrative and share his view. Without the press, without the Royals. I believe it is the beginning of the end of the British Royals. This is long overdue. The British Monarchy has to go."
db,Reviewed in Canada on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,well written!,"I thought this an insightful look behind the scenes of the workings of the royals. Harry and Megan deserve all the best and i simply do not understand all the vitriol from other posts.  Clearly to me anyway, the  cadre remaining are so out of touch that they feel they have to weaponize their press offices. Every family has issues, but these people take it to a whole new level. I can hardly blame Harry for wanting to protect his immediate family since the ones remaining in the palace have so clearly disnfranchised him and Megan whatever their faults. No one is perfect and unlike what is seen in the tabloids, he is honest and straightforward in this book. I can only wish them peace and happiness. It is worth noting the some proceeds from the sales will go to their charities."

erin pizzey,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brave,"Prince Harry is a brave man to write a book like this that is brutally honest. It’s a warts and all story of the life that he has lived dedicated to serving in the armed service, to his country and to his family.  I am ashamed to say that I have maligned Meagan, his wife, believing the stories that I have read about her, and Prince Harry shows her as she really is as willing to devote her life as well to our country and to their family."
CHARITY MATSIWE,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good to finally read about Harry's story in his own words.,Story well written from his childhood up to now when he is a husband and father of two.

Catriona McIntosh,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Creates its own evidence,"Fascinating to compare the text with headlines coming out in real time ‘quoting’ it, and their choice of areas to reframe or remain silent on.

LUCY ANDREWS KOROPCHUK,Reviewed in Canada on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Life Like No Other,"I loved this book and I binge read it. It gave me another side to the story: to be honest, a more believable one. I have never trusted the press as seen though my working career, through the scaremongering period of Covid and now with Prince Harry. The writing was excellent, the portrayal of emotions and feelings vivid, the adventures thrilling not to mention Harry's authenticity in being so candid about his most embarrassing mistakes. I recommend this book to any one  who loves an interesting biography of a life so very different to the average life but more so to Harry & Meghan's harshest critics. Don't berate them based on the media's version of their lives until you've read their side: be a balanced human & get the second side of this turbulent story."
Elizabeth Schuliga,Reviewed in Australia on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Page turner,This book had me hooked from the beginning. A raw and in my opinion a very honest account of his life. A real insight into what he’s had to go through. Loved the book so much

Ms. Jay Bonnington,Reviewed in Australia on 17 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,"I decided to read this book out of curiosity. First part of book I did not enjoy. What a lost Soul!His experiences in Afghanistan etc were an eye opener. Enjoyed reading about his work in Africa etc.But in summary, a sad tale of families with real dysfunctionalities.Do I recommend it? Yes,If you want some insights- then perhaps a way to try and make up your own mind about the entire sorry saga."
WendyUk,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wrapped up in his own cacoon,"This young man needs to get over himself.  He has brought a lot of this trouble onto himself, also implying his close family.Here in England we loved that he was marrying Megan and the whole country went wild, so why didnt he appreciate that and go along with the norm. No one was being racist, they loved her and threw the red carpet out for them. But of course things have to return to normality and this is where I think they went wrong. They thought they were going to be 100% always in the limelight and when that didnt happen, that's where the jealousy of their other family started. Shame,  they brought all these problems on themselves."

Well-written, Harry describes his pain, his sorrow, and his joy, all entering around the loss of his mum at such a young age. I was touched by many of the stories, and saddened to read his accounts. Yes, even a prince can go through hard times. After all, he’s human and this book gives some insight into his humanity. Well done Harry, for telling your own story."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insightful lived experience,"Thanks Prince Harry for sharing your vulnerabilities and lived experiences.  This well-written engaging memoir shines a light on shameful  injustices of hierarchy and class distinctions. All anybody really craves is love, too bad he was discounted by the ones supposedly obligated to protect.  At least he feels the love of his wife, children and beloved mother….gone too soon.  They failed to protect her too.  Shame on the Firm, when all he ever wanted is a family."

It will do you good.Outside these customer pages, this book is being reviewed by the very people it targets. I'm really glad I've actually read the source material, and not taken their word for it.This book is not a nasty, tabloid, tell-all thing. It's just a modern Prince's life so far, which identifies the causes he'd like to do something about while he's alive. Why this matters to him, how he's got there- let him tell you. It will be much faster than looking at the reviews."
Catherine Swinn,Reviewed in Australia on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,he story,I give props to Harry for putting his story forward. That took a lot of strength. I think they have been dealt a rough card and media have totally been behind their story in a very bad way. So sad.

Can’t wait to carry on reading later. Well done Harry on telling your life story.
Jodie G.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most compelling,"A well written, thought invoking insight into the life of Prince Harry. A must read for anyone who is interested in hearing his story, rather than what is spun by the toxic British media."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 18 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,my feelings about the book,"I found this book riveting. I could not put it down. Coming from Africa, I never realized Harry's love for Africa. I am so glad he told his version of the truth.I am also very sorry about the way he has been treated by his family and the British press. This is an intense , sensitive and humble person.I am glad he found Meg. She is the kind of women I would like to have as a friend.Her beauty radiates inside and out.Many young people leave their families. May he have a peaceful happy life with his little family."
MJGilbert,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good read.,This has been my best read in years. I also have the audio version too which in my opinion is a must have.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and Heartfelt,I love that Harry was so open. So honest. Written well. I love that we've been given an insight into his life in his words
Ian,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful and heartbreaking,A beautiful and heartbreaking memoir from Harry. It was easy to read and thoroughly interesting. I wasn't able to put it down. I'd definitely recommend it. Don't listen to what the biased British media has said. Read it for yourselves and make up your own minds.
notexactlyInigoMontoya,Reviewed in Canada on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,a good read,"I enjoyed hearing Harry’s side of the story. The press seem reprehensible and I suspected this long before I read the book. I hope things work out for all of them, because I live for happy endings.Some of the military stuff was quite long. There are descriptions about goats that were bloody and I felt, maybe didn’t need to be included.Overall, a good read and interesting biography, whether you’re a royalist or not."
jane austin,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised…,"I have just finished reading the Kindle sample.  My first thought is how extremely well written it is, how incisive, poetic, with insight and great self awareness . A real surprise.  My second revelation was a precise and devastating realisation of how much of a schism exists between  his father, his brother and himself, with Charles and William forming what appeared to be a relaxed bond between themselves, in league almost against Harry.  I don’t know how much of this autobiography is actually written by the ghost writer or by Harry himself.  It could be a fortunate blend between them.  But on the strength of the writing itself I have just bought the Kindle version."

Klopec,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,I Have Had a Difficult Time With a Review,"I finished this book and couldn't think of what to write as a review. Harry does have severe Mom issues. He and his brother should have had emotional help. He couldn't deal with his family and the death of his Mom.  My father was born in England and the warmth was never forth coming. Never a hug or kiss unless I started it. Never heard ""I Love You"". My mother took her feelings from my Dad and his parents. I don't think Harry should not have written this book. He should have tried to stay in England and gradually move to California. I'm sorry what he and his wife went through. He could have prepared her better. Good luck to both of them, and their children will know a warm and loving relationship rather than the love Windsor's are capable of giving them."

Nicole Ratté,Reviewed in Canada on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful and Touching,"Extremely well written, captivating. Everybody should read it. I was very moved by his story. His tone is gentle, he opened his heart with authenticity and humanity. Do yourself a favor and read this memoire. It will be good for your heart, even if you’ll feel sad and at times angry about how he (and his wife) was treated by the media and let down by his family. He has a great sense of humour and every story is really interesting. It’s a page turner."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,10000% Supporter,"People should purchase their own book, read it and then comment. Take everything in context instead of snippets and relying on biased opinions. In his own words, you feel it and it is refreshing and therapeutic at the same time. Although there are some revelations, he was still guarded to protect his family. I get that and respect it. It was the media that coined the term spare and now he's using it they have a problem with it. He said he's found peace with the family he's created and I'm happy for him and his wife and children. The negative press won't leave them alone but I'm looking forward to the next chapters of their lives. The brothers needed to separate in order to grow and mature along their own paths. It's necessary for mental health. On YouTube there are recordings of Diana talking freely (with voice coach) about her challenges within the institution _ this feels like that. 👍🏾💯💥 ☀️"

Lynn,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Am interesting saga . . .,"The beginning of this book is a flowery chapter that seems disconnected from the rest of the book.Unlike other reviews, I didn’t find it to be a whine fest but rather an accounting of specific times in the life of a modern day prince. Sometimes these were interesting (his description of his military service) sometimes extremely boring (his fantasy tale of meeting Meghan and the mess of their lives).After a life of privilege and no discernible sense of purpose, Prince Harry seem stuck in time with an ambitious spouse whose goals of notoriety and wealth are constant. They seem to be a generational remake of the Duke & Duchess of Windsor with 2 kids in tow.Informative to a point but not historically accurate, entertaining, amusing or even well written.Wait to purchase it until it’s drastically marked down."
Ella B,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fascinating insight into life as a royal,This book is so much more than the titbits that have made the headlines.

Smaybelline,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ignore the media - Here is his truth,Bought for my mum for a birthday present. She loves Harry so I hope she enjoys this book. Don't let the media sway your opinions. Harry & Meghan are just a lovely couple who want to protect themselves and their kids from the media and corrupt monarchy which both contributed to his mother's death. Of course they are going to come out and speak their truth with books and interviews - you'd have to come out and speak your truth after all those headlines and lies that everyone believes. Good luck to them. xAlso if you are a grown man getting upset and angry over a woman you need to look at yourself... you're the problem.

As for the content,  I didn't like the Prince Harry that was being portrayed in the media so decided to read his book.I came to the conclusion that he is overprivledged & spoilt....and doesn't know it! He wants to reject his role & become "" free"". Nothing wrong with that , however he also wants to keep all his privileges that come with being a Prince.I found his book very  contradictory . End result. I probably think even less of him now than before reading the book. I do hope all the money made from sales of the book go to charities,  he certainly doesn't need it.As for his wife, the Duchess,  I have no feelings either way for her. She is who she is."

Faith,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to get through at times.  But I do love Harry.,I found the first part of the book to make me anxious so I was picking up on Harry’s anxiety and paranoia.  I found it kind of hard to get through the middle of the book and so much of the war stories. I do feel Harry’s obsession with the press to be unhealthy.  So they really follow him as much as he says?  I don’t know.  We all see headlines but I’m not sure how much the public really believes or cares.  But yet again I read his book.  Ha.  He is at times funny and very open and raw.  I don’t always trust his memory but it’s his own.  I am happy for his independence and freedom and having his dream of a family.

Laura R,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Should be titled: Anything I've done wrong is someone else's fault,"Going in I knew I'd have a tough time with this book. For a couple that wished to be out of the spotlight they sure are putting themselves front and center to slam the Royal Family.This book was a hard one to review. Did I like it? Not really.  It comes across as whiny. It's poorly written. But I get it - it' his life, and his story to tell. There were no surprises in this book.I'll sum this book up for you quite neatly: The Royal Family is mean. Anything Harry has done wrong is someone else's fault. Meghan is apparently a saint. End of story.The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because of his sincere grief over the loss of his mother."

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what to make of it,"His story is sad and I feel sorry for him losing his mum however some of the stuff he says, like not knowing that Princess Margaret was not allowed to marry the guy she wanted, or that he did not know too much about the abdication or that Meg did not know who Prince Andrew was sounded made up. The book is full of false modesty. The bit about Meg and him in love is like an over the top romantic novel chapter. Don’t know why he is writing a book + interview + documentary + Oprah when he so hates being in the spotlight. One would have been enough to showcase “his side”."

Kona,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Shocking,"Pros:  Absolutely fascinating.  Couldn't put it down.  Often shocking.Cons:  No photo section  Print is too small and too lightI don't imagine there will be any warm Winsor family dinners in the future, due to Harry betraying countless family secrets and insulting all his relatives.  Harry is always Right, naysayers are always Wrong.  Meg is without fault.  Harry tells us the truth/his opinion about everyone and burns bridges right and left.  I'm glad he waited until the Queen passed before publishing.  This would have hurt her terribly.I found the section on Harry's military deployments less interesting than the part about  his marriage, which was jaw-droppingly intense.  Love at first Instagram.  Who knows the truth?"

Cheryl Emmanuel,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gripping,I’m only giving four stars because apparently there are some factual errors but I am so pleased to read Harry’s take on exactly what happened which puts the whole thing in context.  It does ring true due to all the other reading I have done about the RF.  It really doesn’t present them in a good light and leaves me feeling relieved for Harry and Meghan’s sakes the they escaped.  May they have a happy and productive future.

TechHead,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Topical, Maybe even Controversial But a Good read so far!","I pre-ordered the Harry book after all the hype in the media.  Having received it on launch day i haven't been able to put it down.  It is well written by a ghost writer and does read like it is harry own thoughts and words.  Forget personal opinion, read the book and then make your judgement if that is what you choose to do.  I doubt you will ever read another book like this from a royal about one of their lives.  I remember reading his mothers book, a tragic and heartfelt story - my first impression of this book is this is going to be a similar type of read.  When you read it try not to have any preconceived ideas/thoughts - you don't know the lad, this his is truth - don't believe the media twists and tales.  Once you have read cover to cover then feel free to make your own judgement - that's what i intend to do.  I wish him and his family well - he clearly felt the need to tell his side of the story as tragic as that may appear to be."
Kindle Reader,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,So poignant.  This was a magnificent read and I would highly recommend it.  You can actually feel Harry’s experiences and the courage it took to relive it.

NP,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting to a point,"The book starts off well setting a mood and tone with descriptions of sights, sounds, and of course an inside look at magical castles. There is the heart rending remembrances of Diana and the day she died and the long aftermath of such a tragedy. I found the middle of the book rather boring thinking it sounded like I was reading a strangers journal entries. The end was more interesting in that it dealt with Harry and Megan's relationship and all the political maneuvering behind the scenes. Sad that insecurity and jealousy played such a role in the whole drama. Happy that the two have found each other, but over all the book was a bit boring."

The book has an overall sadness, but there are many paragraphs that offer glimpses of funny stories from his childhood...emotional moments with his father or grandmother...moments of love with Meghan...loved it, and I am happy he shared his memories with us...I loved the paragraphs related to his father...a complicated relation with a man that was not good at expressing his feelings...but seems to have tried somehow."

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read this biography and decide for yourself,"Spare is eloquently written and an unflinching story of grief, betrayal, joy, and resilience. It is intelligent, strategic, graceful, and at the same time both heartbreaking and heartwarming.I highly recommend this book for its clarity of the author’s own narrative and about his and his immediate family’s escape from a highly toxic institution that could easily become modernized for the 21st century, if only there was a willingness to listen carefully and respectfully to Prince Harry’s ideas."

Sio1908,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry's side of the story,"It's not easy to share your side of the story and be vulnerable. It's even harder if you're Prince Harry, especially knowing that the press will manipulate your words. When you've lived a life where you've been told to keep quiet and that you're not allowed to challenge incorrect stories in the media, it is not surprising that Prince Harry has taken this chance to tell his side of the story.The hate the press has whipped up for Prince Harry and Meghan is unbelievable and it is awful that some of the public have bought into it. The fact that some of the royal family have been a part of this by leaking stories or exchanging information is inexcusable. Reading this book will help you to understand why Prince Harry decided to leave and put his wife and children first. I don't understand how his father and brother have allowed Prince Harry to be thrown under the bus for their own gain.It takes a brave man to say enough is enough and to make sure history doesn't repeat itself with his own family. Thank you Prince Harry for sharing your story."

Aletheuon,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fascinating,"The first thing I noticed about this book is that it is beautifully written and richly detailed. How much  ofthis is owed to Prince Harry and how much to his ghostwriter, I have on idea, but it is clear that the prince is a highly intelligent and sensitive human being. The second thing was the total lack of comprehension of his point of view by his father and brother. And there is the heart of the tragedy - two sides with such differing points of view that communication and reconciliation seem no more than a dream. Part of it, I think, is that Meghan is American and a successful and independent woman in her own right and submitting to the ways of such a buttoned-up and  well-defended family was never going to be possible for her. The clash of cultures and values led to tragedy. Poor Harry! Poor Charles and William, knowing the responsibility that rests on their shoulders and the tradition they must fight for and uphold. So many people take sides and try to say that one or other side in this painful conflict is lying or whinging, but who is any outsider, to make such a judgment? Prince Harry tells the story as he experienced it, no doubt inaccurately at times, since memory is fallible, but with  painful honesty.  Whether he is wise to do so is a matter of judgment."

Kensson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Those who live their life through the tabloids will still hate him - good read for the rest of us!,"Good honest first hand account of somebody who experienced the tactics of the British tabloid idiots first hand.The point I take from the book is not a 'for or against Harry,' but rather a wake up call to those who believe everything they read in the press. Some may choose to ignore the way and reason headlines are written, but to act upon that fiction in your lives is dangerous and that is what Harry is highlighting. Unfortunately, some will still believe the narrative they want to believe...."

Bloom,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting, honest account of being inside the bubble","Some of the reactions and reviews I've read in the press or in other quarters seem to be incredibly skewed versions of what is actually committed to print here. But as its taking huge swipes at the British gutter press and the bile it can incite, I suppose that's to be expected. Surely no one expects an autobiography to be great literature and this isn't but its genuinely engaging and heartfelt and probably the closest any of us have come to peeking behind the curtains of unvarnished royal family life. Yes, it makes the family look a bit disfunctional and weird, like most families do to outside eyes, but this book highlights how such an intimate relationship with the press only makes things worse. Criticism that its airing the families dirty laundry in public have obviously missed the point. Harry comes across as self deprecating, funny and thoughtful but at times, there are moments especially early in the book that are gratingly immature. There is a sort of redemption arc occuring throughout though and finished it admiring the journey he'd been on so far. I actually felt sympathy for the whole family, they're written about with a love, generally, which was quite touching. Worth a read, whatever side of the fence you're on."

D. Fowler,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,A book about what has been lost … the love of a once cherished family,"I’ve never been fond of memoirs denigrating an individual who cannot respond to alleged wrongdoings.  The one utmost in my mind is Cristina Crawford’s, “Mommy Dearest.”  On one level this ghostwritten tome, is yet another on of those.  The accused royal family cannot or will not respond to the former royal’s accusations of one hundred and one allegations leveled against them.No, I haven’t read the entire book … yet.  This book, however, has come out in the Spanish edition, quite a bit of which I’ve read via other individuals.  The book starts out quite flowery, unexpectedly so, unlike the Harry we’ve all seen and heard recently.  What I have come away with is great respect for a family who has kept silent and not responded or hit back.  Perhaps they understand more about this prodigal member than we do.For one who wishes a reconciliation with the family he left behind, this book is a poor way to accomplish said goal.  Drama does sell. This I know because I bought into it here.  I do want to hear what Harry has to say; however, I feel that what he has lost in life is sad.

Catherine Wylie,Reviewed in Canada on 14 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!  Very well written!,I am happy Harry had the courage to leave so he and Meghan could be free to share their perspective and live their lives their way.  The old power over monarchy died with Queen Elizabeth.  Charles and William have an opportunity to create an empowered conscious monarchy starting with an apology to Harry and his family!

Ashley Lynn,Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tone deaf,"Spoiler Alert: I adore Prince Harry, and the Royal family. The first half of the book was good! I enjoyed stories from when he was younger and his military career. It was the last bit that really came off as the ultimate victims tale. It was like he and Megan could not understand how they were never number one in The Queen’s, Prince Charles’, Price Williams’s minds. Not taking a moment to think of all the other things going on in the world then the press attacking your wife."
H,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,An insight,"This is pretty much a warts and all expose of what it is like to grow up within as well as join the normally closed, protected ranks of the Royal Family where public image is everything and what goes on behind closed doors stayed that way. Except it appears it doesn’t if the Palace want the story out there and to control the narrative. I have sympathy for the late Queen’s standard to say nothing in response to matters, which probably helped to maintain the mystery, although possibly didn’t help with the current situation. This lifts the lid on a number of areas, some of which should perhaps have stayed unsaid; an interesting read although perhaps some things should not have been shared. I would probably read/get any future instalment if there is anything left unsaid, but it seems life inside the Royal Palaces isn’t as good as you would expect it to be. It makes everyone seem more human, no matter how gilded and privileged all of their existence."

Doubtful it will change the course of the monarchy but kudos to him for telling his truth.It is to be hoped moving forward, he leads a productive forward looking life and doesn’t end up hawking suits and sponging off his connections like  the Duke of Windsor. Rise above, close the door and continue to support selfless service. Put an end  to the media blitz and live a good life"

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Authentic, needed and surprising","I had to leave a review as How else can we let Harry and Megan know that we have read this book and understand their message and their plight because the press are still dictating and printing their opinion of the ‘public reaction’ to everything Megan and Harry have done recently.I consider myself to be a well educated and well read person who challenges and questions before I take an opinion BUT, reading this I see that even when I’m reading a credible newspaper (Guardian, Observer’ etc) I’m still seeing the bias and angle someone else, a journalist or editor has chosen on a certain topic- and as this book shows, I don’t know their motivations .Point is- this book was an eye opener to me and my feeling is that I’m glad they have found a peaceful life; that Harry finally has the warm and loving family he deserves and really what else matters? I believe their story and I hope many others do too."

How many children would have given their right hand to have half and a quarter of what he was born into  yet to hear him talk to the media and the men at the palace made his life hell and unfortunately it is  not going to end  here She is writing one"
William C,Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His words. His story!,I highly appreciate that Prince Harry took the step to tell his story while his whole life was told through the lens of biased media.

I wish all the best to H and M! They did what they should.

The Royal rules and guidance I agree with some ,but Harry doesn't want that kind of life as he witnessed what it did to his beautiful Mum. He is protecting his wife and children. Don't believe what you see in the media, read the truth. I have always been a huge fan of Prince Harry, yes I don't agree with everything he has done, but he is human after all and nobody is perfect. This book is without a doubt an amazing read and my admiration for this young Prince has increased ten fold."

anthony,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of shouting for someone who desperately wants privacy for his family’s and himself!!!!!!,It is truly baffling that why Harry has written this book.Harry says he values privacy but obviously not other people’s or his own. You can’t shout and then remain private.He writes about his bust up with William and the physical fight as though no two other brothers have ever done that.Go grow up Harry.

Amazed,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Discovering hard realities in a bubble,"Prince Harry’s voice is to be honored as is his account of childhood, courtship and marriage. Ultimately, though, it is a story of a shockingly sheltered life awakening.The awakening Harry and Meghan‘s marriage fomented was unavoidable. And such things, unfortunately, come through suffering in every corner of the story. The monarchy will not be the same after this book. Nor should it."
"Andrew A , London UK",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve now become team Harry.,I was once sceptical about Harry and his new life in the US. I couldn’t understand why he abdicated his position in the family and moved abroad.  Having read the book you get a deep passage into his life story and thoughts. I’m not a great fan of Meghan whom want to be a future IS presidential candidate but in terms of Harry he has won me over. I’m now very sceptical of William and Kate and the perfect picture book life they try to portray to the punters.
Cookingandtravel ,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A human being,"Prince Harry is a human being, born into a situation that he could not escape from, until he did. This is a beautifully written–yes, subjective–memoir and it is incredible to hear him tell it through J.R. Moehringer, one of the best memoir writers ever.Harry has also left a lot unsaid that would have really hurt the royal family in a much bigger way, as many people in London know the real scandals behind the scenes. And as he said in the Tom Bradby interview, the royal family wrote their own book about him the last few years, so this really shouldn't be seen as a surprise that he wanted to tell his story his own way."

Jerry Solomon,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hopeless Harry,"There is always two sides to each story and I have yet to hear the Royals side. For Megan, this was a definite culture shock and for Harry, since birth, he always considered himself the spare. He never understood  the meaning of primogeniture which was part of the British royal society. Was Megan used as an excuse and an escape from Harry’s life as a senior royal."

JCook,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spare: Nicely Written,"I found this a good insight to the workings of “the image keeping” of the Royal Family.  It is a good retelling of  events from Harry’s point of view.  Within the family are two different viewpoints each not understanding the other, not due to lack of caring, but because of being frozen in each one’s own perception.  JC"
nancy green,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spare,I bought this book because of all the hype and information that is being put out there.

Taryn Freeman,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting read.,I am not sure how I feel about this book. It felt really passive aggressive.

Lucinda Foster,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant read,"Nice to finally read Harry’s own words, rather than the trash and lies written by the British Press. Truly horrifying to think that the media felt it was acceptable to write such awful articles and bully him when he was a child.Harry is most definitely my favourite Royal, and speaking as a Mother, my heart really does go out to him. It’s a shame his Father didn’t do a better job of supporting him when he needed it most.Highly recommend this book."
tim betambeau,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,At last the Truth,Well done This is a great historical read. It shows members of the Royal family in their true dysfunctional light. A story of tragedy and alive and a fight to have the truth heard Not to be missed.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic and heartfelt,"This is a raw, authentic and compelling book which I wish some of the haters would read. It might just slow their rush to condemn a young man who speaks with such candour and clarity. Highly recommended."
AudiDoodi,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A brilliant book.,I just needed to buy this asap. My wife is so happy she loves it.
Yafa Crane Luria,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to like it more,"I'm glad Prince Harry has had his say. I think he and Meghan are wonderful. I just didn't like the plodding pace. Part 2, for me, was pretty boring. The best parts were when he was in Africa and hearing about Meghan."
Sandyhasdogs,Reviewed in Canada on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moving,Bravo for taking control and telling your truth. It is shameful how you and your wife were treated by the British media and the ‘Institution’. I hope you find happiness and peace.

jess,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eloquently written,"I’ve only just begun reading but so far I have enjoyed every minute. Inner thoughts are described genuinely and clearly stated as to whether they are fact or opinion. I felt compelled to write this review as the book, so far, versus the reviews from media are worlds apart. Don’t base your assumption of this book on the media’s portrayal; read it and decide for yourself.Side note to add; If my own child was to ever speak about me, their mother, with an ounce of the reverence and brilliance described in this book I would burst with pride."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,So well written and funny,This book is full of humour and so well written. Harry’s description in Chapter 1 of the adults in the ‘Dinner Dungeon’ at Balmoral Castle had me cracking up. It’s awful how the tabloid media has portrayed the book. It’s not at all vindictive. You come away from it feeling sorry for Harry. He is a strong person to have borne such abuse and still have a positive outlook.
kk,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly balanced,The media would have everyone believe Spare is one long moan about perceived slights and extended unfair criticism of the Royal Family. So I was surprised to find this a really interesting and informative read of an individual who is reflecting on their lived experience as a member of the British Monarchy.What is an alarming takeaway is the apparent relationship between the Royal Household and the press. No wonder the coverage around the book has been so biased.
DebH,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truth,"Finally his story instead of the normal media circus surrounding him, about time he got a say in his own life.  Really good read."
Julie Stenhouse,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt and very sad,"I have remained impartial to all the hype leading towards the book. The Oprah Winfrey interview, The Netflix series the UK and The USA interviews and Harry's book The Spare. I find it all very sad from both sides. However tonight I watched the skit with Harry and Tom Hanks and the American interview where Harry is drinking shots and prior to Harry's appearance the show is already making fun of WHO??. Harry and THE QUEEN. HARRY'S BELOVED GRANDMOTHER, With whom Harry claims to love and adore and have an amazing relationship with ""God rest her soul"" But  there he is making fun of her too. That was the limit for me, although Harry joins in laughs and drinks, I bet he went home feeling absolutely wretched as he should with that interview. Your mother would be so proud of you ( not). These people are not your friends Harry. They are only using you to make fun and money from you. I hope you and your families from both sides of the pond eventually find peace and happiness."
C. Jackson Blair,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,boring,I like biographies. This was overhyped. Provided little new information. Basically a kid with serious psychological issues from the death of his mother that were not addressed by a cold family and were in the news throughout his life.
Cheryl R.,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,full of contradictions,The book was well written. Of course there was a ghost writer. It is the content that is disturbing. Prince Harry seems to be very angry with his family and especially his brother and father.

Sigridrose,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Easy read,"This book has an easy flow. Mostly about a man’s longing for the love of his mother. Some funny, some endearing and some sad stories. I hope this book will bring emotional well being to the Spare."
M HARROD,Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compelling read,"I couldn’t put it down. I found harry likeable and his tale was one of survival. In many places it read like a love letter to his family, I hope they read it."
LW,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptionally well told memoir,Beautiful reflection of a life lived in the tabloid media glare. Both Meghan and Harry have been treated abominably. Worth reading as the media have chosen to print a few sentences out of context and spun them to look trivial and petty. Harry seems to be the most well balanced member of the Royal family. Admirable.

Jon Westley,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautifully written, engaging, thought provoking...","Whatever your view of the decisions made in publishing this book, it has been beautifully written and shows integrity in delivering what you would expect of an autobiography. Whatever this is, it is not banal or a safe piece of writing. I am quite certain that it was written with candour and that makes it at times uncomfortable reading. It is interesting as much for being a story about a human being as it is for being a story about the Royal family. This not the place for a discussion on why it was written, the veracity of its claims or its impacts, which I think will be many. What matters is that as an autobiography, on those limted terms, it excels. Recommend."

Sarah,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,The tragic tale of Prince Haz,"I'm only 1/4 of the way in but his simple descriptions of 'everyday' Royal life and decision making have brought me to tears. I've worked professionally with abused children and if Harry was in any other family he would have been taken into care and given therapy from an early age , Charles too probably. Time this outmoded institution went! If I was on the fence about the Monarchy before now I know that they need to be abolished as it can never change, even if 'modernised' because that would be impossible. Thank you Harry for telling your story and I'm so glad you survived to tell the tale. Good luck to them all."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Australia on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,"This book really paints a picture of how ridiculous an institution the Royal Family really is.

Moving, compelling … and really bloody funny!","Ignore everything you’ve read about it, and go in with an open mind. Easily one of the best books I have ever read - I wasn’t expecting the wonderful laugh-out-loud humour, or the heartbreaking beauty of his story. It’s like the press who ‘reported’ on the book have read some other book entirely! (Funny that!) Seriously though - read it and judge for yourself. His integrity, his raw honesty and his good heart shine through. And I’m still giggling!"

I'm on chapter 9, and it's a revelation. Harry's narration skills are perfect. I feel many different emotions as Harry's voice details his experience within the surreal life he's been born into. Harry's a deep, complex, astute, sensitive, empathetic, gentle & honest man -  this is what shines through in his book. Don't think about it, get the book. Listen and read, and discover how Harry became Harry. Harry deserves the best things in life, and I look forward to seeing him and Meg having a long, safe, joyful & successful marriage and family."

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Complete lack of self awareness.,"Where do I begin? I doubt very much Harry actually wrote this book. The style is very similar to a bad romantic novel, with shades of a thriller thrown in.Indeed, the book is at its best when describing Harry's military service, a time in his life where he appeared to be genuinely happy.But overall the reader is left with the impression of resentment (that Harry is the spare, not heir). William is cast in a bad light, Charles and Camelia not much better. The description of Charles doing handstands in his boxer shorts is not one I will forget in a hurry. Neither, for that matter, reading about how Harry suffered from a frost bitten penis!Not a biography I would recommend."

Rebecca Cook,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Harry gets his say,"Really interesting insight into Harry’s experience growing up after the really traumatic death of his mother. You can understand why he’s speaking out, after having lies written about him for most of his life. I respect him for being accountable, rather than hiding behind royal ‘sources’ and ‘friends of the royals’. There are some funny and heartwarming moments too. Also, it’s much better to hear what he has to say in context, rather than poorly translated excerpts in the newspaper."
AF,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A riveting read,"I found this to be a riveting read and very well written. I am happy for Harry that he finally has a chance to tell his story. As someone who exited a dysfunctional family, I related to his story in many ways.I normally find stories of war and military stuff highly boring so I think it’s a testament to the good writing that I didn’t get bored and put the book down when it got to that part."
Fiona,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,His story to tell,"kindle & audio version : thoroughly enjoying so far, so glad he’s been able to write this, it’s his story in his words, his lived experience not the opinion of an “expert” who’s never met him & got their information from “sources” to fit a narrative being played out in the biased media"

LoLo,Reviewed in Canada on 12 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Harry Gives Away Too Much!,There is lots to learn about Harry and Meghan's struggles but he has done a hatchet job on his whole family while at the same time professing that he wants to reconcile with them. It is embarrassing how many very personal details he has included. It makes him look so immature! He has a lot of outstanding achievements. I don't doubt that Harry and Meghan have reason to complain but they also must accept responsibility for the mistakes they have made.
Lady Roo,Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,A bit disappointing,"Puts Harry’s side of events, but has some major factual errors plus quite a few disjointed stories that just tail off and don’t give the ending of what was being talked about, leaving the reader hanging, which I found frustrating. A mixture of feelings when reading it - sometimes sympathy, sometimes annoyance (he does whine an awful lot). Overall, I won’t be rushing to re-read it."

TheDubliner,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A nasty, gossipy book full of hatred","This a nasty, gossipy book that leaves one feeling soiled after reading it, due to the vicious and unwarranted attacks made by Prince Harry on members of his family. Even when his father King Charles helps him out, to send him to rehab after one of his many drug episodes, Harry is bitter and resentful and questions his father's good faith. I have never read a more paranoid account of family life, it's clear too that Harry doesn't just resent his brother William, he seems to actually hate him, which is truly sad. What is striking is how passive Harry seems to be throughout the book, it's as if everyone else is doing things to him, and everyone else is to blame for anything bad happening to him. The flip side of Harry's passivity is that he never takes responsibility for anything. Harry seems to be a very troubled individual, who needs to get a proper job (probably in Africa) in order to take his mind off the past, and one seriously doubts whether L.A. is the healthiest place for him to be just now - it's clear too that the people he has surrounding him in California just now don't have his best interests at heart."
Nyoka Anderson,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"Harry made money on this book and I lost money.  Too dramatic and full of trash.  Why do I need to know when and how he lost his virginity, or his foray into drugs?  I ended up pitying Harry and losing respect for both Harry and Megan.  All families have problems, but not all families have money which makes Harry's a tad bit more interesting.  The one thing I did enjoy was the author's walks through history.  Overall, I was so disappointed."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Boring,"I love reading and also about the Royal Family. I was so excited to get this book. I just thought it was boring and about just normal family problems. I have a brother and we had our fights and still do but I would never write a book about details that go on in a family. That is why there is so much help if you need to talk to someone and he does have a therapist. All the complaining about how his wife was treated was too much. Beautiful kind loving Meaghan, Sure its true but no one is perfect. I think Harry would have done much better if he had written a book about his mother. Don't waste your money on this wait and get it at the library."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Canada on 11 January 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings,On the one hand he sounds like an entitled brat and on the other you can't help but feel for someone who lost his mom in front of the world the way both brothers did. Either or I could not put the book down.
curious,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry did not write this book,"I thought this was going to be a book in Prince Harry's words.  It's not.  I'm only half way through the first chapter and don't know if I can even finish the book. Harry did not write this book, and whoever the ghost writer is needs to learn how to write in the subject of the books words.  The page long paragraphs describing things in a way nobody speaks are off putting to say the least.  Please Harry, if you ever put out another book, write it yourself!it's"
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Spare Me this Spare!,"What a snoozefest!  Or a whine-fest rather.  There is nothing new here at all.  The entire book is Harry just moaning about how unfair everyone and everything is to him and later to Megan.  He speaks of his family with such venom and disdain you would think he was talking about strangers.  The only one he doesn't eviscerate is the Queen but still, he intimates her lack of help to him.  There is no surprise message here, just him complaining.  The writing is plain dreadful, loaded with incomplete thoughts and snippets of stories that have no real cohesiveness.  What is lacking is what people really would love to hear about - his memories of his mother, his life with her, and his interactions with the rest of the family (real ones not just complaints).  I skipped over all the boring stuff of which there is plenty.  He doesn't mention Meg's sister or brother at all, which is interesting.  Was he worried he'd be sued for defamation or was he just trying to pretend they didn't exist since they had Meg's number all along?  If you are thinking about purchasing this book, do not bother.  Anything you need to know has already been reported on in the Daily Mail or other sources.  I'm getting a refund for this big book of boringness.  All it did was make me love the Royal Family even more and wish them luck against Harry and Meg, who like Diana are simply bound and determined to bring them down out of their own unhappiness with themselves.  Pathetic."

Diane Norburn,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Boring and petulant,"Whilst there are some interesting elements,  the constant wow-is-me attitude throughout the whole book is annoying. He constantly presents a privileged, spoiled, self-centred and petulant individual with no real grasp on the real troubles and worries of the public.He is annoyed that a staff member blocks light in his rent-free Kensington Palace flat. Seriously? Know what it's like to worry about paying your mortgage and energy bills.  This made me skip chapters."

This completely biased book would have broken Her late Majesty's heart.  I think both Harry and Cruella need to stop and get on with their lives, all links with our Royal Family should be severed as far as titles are concerned.  Just concentrate on reuniting the family."
Marianne Bonner,Reviewed in the United States on 16 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Whingy and Whiney,"After less than 100 pages, I no longer think I am reading about Harry and Meghan but about “Whingey and Whiney.” Harry has my sympathy regarding the loss of his mom at so tender an age. But he’s now 38. I thought of the young children of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. They eventually have to move on and adjust to life without a beloved parent. An entire nation doesn’t coddle or make excuses for them indefinitely- certainly not past acceptable shelf life! They have to GROW UP!!  400 pages of “poor me” alternating with throwing your family under the bus is tiresome and pathetic! Mixing in loss of virginity and a frozen todger is absolutely juvenile. What will his kids think of this mess? Finally, if you are truly disgusted with the monarchy, yaddah- yaddah — why not just say “take this title and shove it!!??”  Oh yeah- that’s a key part of what makes you so marketable!! You do absolutely nothing to earn it but it definitely works for you. But what’s a lack of principle after what you’ve been through?"

Jessika,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon blocked my first review - shady!!,"I have never had Amazon block a review before.  I’m shocked and disgusted.  In sum, this book is disappointing.  There are very little details and it’s very one sided.  Harry has little to no self-awareness and blames everyone else for all his issues.  To me, it seems like he over reacted to everything, I cringed or rolled my eyes a lot, as wished I hadn’t bought the book.  If he didn’t like the trade off of media scrutiny, he should relinquish his title and go live a private life."

Marlena,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Whiney and boring. Done k own if I will be able to finish it,"From the beginning, I thought a lot of the writing was a bit over blown. Every little thing was SO VERY IMPORTENT.. As to the famous fisticuffs.  I had 2  boys who were close.  They fought, that's siblings. I really disliked how much private family information was put out, things I may say to a lose c!owe friend, but not the public.  Hee is still a young teen, not a grown jp!"
Mrs S Smith,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sad,"This book is sad. It moves from lovely descriptions of surroundings to the narrative of a sad, hurt and angry boy who is seeing everything from his own perspective. I feel sorry for many of those he describes and felt that he has degraded his family through some of the unnecessary details he has shared."
S_Ba,Reviewed in Italy on 21 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,100 pages would have been enough,"I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews. I found the book dull and in some parts really boring. The last 90-100 pages actually summarize the point: The royal family has an unhealthy love-hate relationship with the press, uses it to undermine other members of the family,  and  there's a lot of envy and resentment among family members. I believe that in Harry and Meghan's case, there is also a lot of racism.  Happy that Harry admits to having mental health issues, but really it's the entire family."
Ela Ryan,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,awful,"I dont know if its the ghost writers normal writing style, or if its Harrys own words, or a combination? I could not read this, the language used was nothing but 'woe is me', it came off as really pathetic.The other problem was that when harry had a conversation instead of actually writing the whole of what was said, we just got his interpretation of what was 'meant' and a little piece of the conversation taken out of context. To me this can only be because he is trying to control the narrative instead of being honest about what was said and letting us form our own opinions about it.I honestly barely read any of this book, I just could not get past this 'woe is me attitude' or the fact that this is obviously not a honest, or should I say 'open' account of events, but an account to control a narrative."
Shirley Holton,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is awful,"Have to hand it to Harry he has elevated whinging intoan art form. Misery in mansions, persecution in palaces. Is there no end to his suffering?"
QueenOfPentacles,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,All over the place,"There's no rhyme or reason as to the order in which Harry talks about his life. Most autobiographies are chronological, starting at the author's birth, then moving through their childhood and into adulthood. Harry's book is just one rant after the next, in no apparent order."

Pathd,Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting if you can set aside disbelief,"Harry calls the butler who wrote about his mother ""merely one man's self-justifying, self-centering version of events"". That describes this book perfectly. My regret is not in reading it -- it's interesting, but in adding even a dollar to the pockets of a ""prince"" who slams his family with a one-sided book that puts everyone but himself, his mother and his wife in the worst possible light."
Angela Bolan,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,A really painfully slow and boring read for most all of the book,"I was excited to read this and could barely get through the 1st half. Found myself scanning over pages to find something interesting to read during the military stories. Just way too many irrelevant details throughout the book. I wanted to love it, but Harry just came off as immature and accepting little if any responsibility at all for his life. A tough read friends...#TRUTH"
peggy james,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Boring,"I bought this book because I wanted to understand the person behind all the drama.  Unfortunately what I found is a person who is at the same time incredibly spoiled and incredibly neglected and needy.  I found the whole thing to be sad and boring, but I hope Harry is able to get some much needed therapy and move on now."

JM,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,SAVED BY THE GHOSTWRITER,"Had it not been for talented J. R. Moehringer, this book would have been -- not in a recycle bin but a garbage bin. What a 1 sided book of complaints & jealousy. When I first heard that his book was worse that a tabloid I bought it only to check this for myself as I was not sure that all the reviewers were right. To think someone who had so much privilege and royal upbringing to trash the family that gave him all this just because he was not first born. Jealousy has no cure and Meghan only festered it for financial gains. There were parts of the book that felt like it was Meghan's words & voice not Harry's. Once again- it's only the ghostwriter & the  You Tube reviewers who need a compliment  & I should have listened to You Tube first , rather than go through 400 odd pages of constant whinging. Check Tom Bower's book for facts rather than this one for fiction. This should be classified as fiction not a memoir."
Gabrielle Bailey,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the most exciting book,It works well to send me to sleep
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money like I did.,"William Faulkner's quote, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past"" is a ridiculous forward used in the book 'Spare'. Faulkner once said that, ""he longed for the return of the benevolent autocracy of slavery in which negroes would be better off because they'd have someone to look after them"" was in the 'New Yorker,' Nov. 30, 2020 Issue.  I question the validity of what is written in the book.  I doubt if Harry knows about William Faulkner, his books, and how his stated beliefs contradicts many of his writings.The ghost writer should have found a different quote to entice readership.  Don't waste your money - buy a bottle of wine instead of a book that whines."
Mrs H.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,No!,"I never write reviews, but felt compelled to write this one. Bought the book out of curiosity, and really wish I hadn’t. It reads like a sulky teenager’s diary. I couldn’t even finish it. Made me cringe and now we learn it probably isn’t even correct because, his memory remembers as it sees fit!!!!! In other words it may not be strictly accurate. Fiction or fact? You make up your own mind."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok,This was more about Harry him shelf than the Royal family. I like Harry but I wanted to hear more about the family. It's just an ok book nothing to write home about.
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hmmm,Not at all convincing as Prince Harry's voice. 'Graham' crackers???? We Brits don't know of them because they are exclusively American and it is vastly unlikely that such an item would occasion a nickname in Prince Harry's mind for a protection officer. American rubbish. Painfully obvious.
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Boring & Boastful of Privilege,Reads as a flowery novel - nothing new as so much about the book either leaked in the run up to the release or disclosed in TV interviews. It’s terribly sad that Harry lost his mother at a young age and the Princes should have had therapy during childhood/ teenage years. This book does Harry no favours at all … amongst the self pity there is a lot of bragging about the wealth and privileges he’s enjoyed. It’s so boring that I am now skim reading the last 3/4 of the book. A waste of money.
Scott K,Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and well written but PH is quite pathetic,"Like most people, my opinion of Harry has changed since reading this book. The difference is that I think less of him now.I can’t remember ever reading anything as cringe worthy and self obsessed. This man just lives for drama. I now understand why he is leaving in Tinseltown, in the United States. He certainly belongs there. The whole thing reads like a poorly produced B list movie. A fictional movie at that."

Vikki Liles,Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,What are we when everyone is a victim?,"Rarely have I read anything so sad.  He is one of the most privileged people in the world, and yet sees himself as nothing but a victim.  He is not the only child whose parents divorced or whose mother died too soon.  He has no perspective.  I cannot imagine much reconciliation with his father, his stepmother, his brother or his sister-in-law after the claims and allegations he made.  And for those who admire how beautifully the book was written - it was done so by a ghostwriter, not Harry.  A read that wallows in self-pity, resentment and jealousy."

Writing quality is poor.  Sentences consisting of 1-, 2-or 3 words??  Really??  Easy to fill a page that way.  If you turn all these mini sentences into standard paragraphs, the book would be 208 pages instead of 416!!

You learn how they met and dated, and then it goes on to nothing except his time in service. It was long and I finally flipped over it waiting for the big shocker or whatever and it never came. Same thing we already know. Good luck to them. One day he may write another one about the mistake he made. I feel bad for anyone born Royal. It is no picnic and he didn’t choose to have that life. He was born into it. I wish them nothing but the best."

Only a truly miserable person could be so unhappy with so much given to him. Couldn’t even make it to the Meghan years. I work with abused children who have awful and poor childhood experiences. This book made me angry at such ungrateful and bratty behavior and mindset. I can’t finish this book. It’s awful.
Katie,Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Entitled and Bitter,"Just an angry book from a little rich kid who doesn’t want to work and neither does his wife. He was cut of but didn’t want to touch his over 20million inheritance because he wants to save it for his kids, couldn’t be to broke if that’s the case. How big does the house need to be? Seems he was fine until his wife pointed out everything and he realised how bad his life was. And that he should be entitled to so much more and to cut him off from everyone she convinced him he was only a spare and he could save his mum through her.so much detail about nothing and little details about what actually happened so he can not be called on it. So many contradictions out of his own mouth. I felt bad for him but now I can not stand him or his wife. Entitled selfish child who wants everything and does nothing. Shame"

The book seemed well written to me, meaning that I don't see many errors in punctuation or grammar.

Cruel to write about Pat the matron at Ludgrove School was so cruel. As a child you said these things to make people laugh but to repeat it as an adult, shame on you. We all have problems with our family, especially siblings, but to write about it for the world to read for the almighty $ I find disgusting. There are so many inaccuracies, you blame on memory loss, well then don’t write about them. There is no accountability you blame everybody else. Really a very sad book you are filled with so much hatred towards your family. It is a blessing the Queen has died and couldn’t read it."
J. M. Miller,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,I was disappointed in the book. Not only are multiple facts incorrect but he is whining about things that are normal in a lot of families. Brother doesn’t want to know you at school? That has NOTHING to do with Heir/Spare. That’s siblings. It’s just the muttering of a jealous younger brother and his American wife that didn’t understand what she married into.

Rosalie,Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Boring,"A big disappointment.  Maybe because I’ ve read and watched so much already.  Nothing new here.  I like Harry,  not so much Meghan.  I predict they won’t be together five years from now."

So against my better judgement, I purchased it.  So, we'll see...."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 11 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,A DISGRACE,"This is a work of fiction, albeit well-written by a ghost writer. There is no substance in the text and there are many contradictions. It was a waste of money. Meghan is behind it. Revenge."
Holly Rae Fergus,Reviewed in the United States on 14 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Boring Rubbish,Nothing new.Just his perspective  post Meghan but military career background was somewhat interesting but about 15 chapters too long.Skip and read the journalists reviews instead. Total waste of my time and money.
DJ,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great for insomnia,"Way too long, too much of a pity party, and so so boring.  Kept falling asleep after every five or six pages.  I only wish I had his problems. Wait for the cliff notes."
Catherine Rousseau,Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,it really is kind of boring,I have not finished the book yet but the first third I would have to say is pretty boring with a lot of finger pointing going on. Always painting himself as the victim.
Melissa B.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,The Netflix doc is more interesting and to the point (and all of the Meghan parts are in the doc--there is literally no new info in this book). This book is very long-winded.

bookworm,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Read,"So much sadness and hurt in our Royal Family, lots caused I think by envy, money and greed.  I hope  Prince Harry, Meghan and their family find peace and know this I do not read newspapers ever.II think there's too much unpleasantness in this world why can't we all live and let live."
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hugs to Harry and Mehgan,"I am so glad Harry wrote this book.  I really got a feel for who he is, what he's  been through, and the man he is and will be in the future.I was pregnant at the same time Princess Diana was  with Harry, and I had my child 4 days after he was born.  My mother died 27 days after his mother died.  I was heartbroken for them. Then as an adult, I was inconsolable when my mother died. Like everyone else in America, I was thrilled by Diana's love for her boys, and torn up when she died.  My thoughts as I read this book-heartbreak again to read what he went through, how their mothers death has effected them to this day, and blown away to see the difference between the brothers in how they survived it.  I felt I understood Harry's feelings, the effects of being a Royal, a Spare, the coldness of adults who should have thought of them instead of themselves, and the cruel harassment of the press throughout his life, the fear for his wife and children, as well as the anger and helplessness in the way he lost his mother. I've read the insulting and heartless reviews of his book, all of them purposefully ignoring the fact that he is a human being, just like the rest of us, but not allowed to be anything more than an object to manipulate.So I want to thank you Harry, for sharing yourself with us.  I ""hear you"". I loved your humor, your sharing some of the highs of meeting your wife and having your son, the low points that lead you to therapy.  I'm sorry you have gone throughI agree with your wife, you are a ""real man"" in my eyes, not afraid to speak the truth and tell the truth of who you are.  I truly feel I've met you!  Thank you again for sharing what you did with us.  It makes this grandmother happy to see all you've done and continue to do, to find your place in the world and go after it unapologetically.  You have the heart of your mother-love never dies.  I too believe she is with you. Know there are many of us that care about you and your family!"
debbie,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful book,I loved every word. It was very well written and I saw side to Harry and Meg that I didn't know existed. I love them both
Peggy L. Jacobs,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much anticipated book,Will be reading the book soon.
Kindle Customer,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and sad,"Really good liked the stories told and a peak inside the royal family,  but more liked the story of a boy growing up and dealing with so much and standing up for himself regardless of the huge impact it would have. I thoroughly enjoyed this and felt sad it had to happen like this."
Debbie Cona,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyed reading his side of HIS story,Easy read. I was fascinated with details of life inside the palace walls. I realize it’s Harry’s point of view but I’m not offended by that. I’d happily read any other royal family member’s memoir as well.
Southern Senior,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,I believe him,Well written. I think he's being completely honest.  He makes no excuses for anything he did in the past and owns up to everything. He did however manage to change my opinion of Prince William. Prince Harry deserved better.
Sandi Mitchell,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly written and eye opening.,Loved Spare! Harry talked a lot about his military missions I found fascinating and the feelings he had about his Mother. Just a great book… I could not put it down!
Deborah Sharp,Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Book!,"Well done Harry, your Mum would be so proud of you ! I will be honest , I had my doubts before I started reading this book, I thought it was just going to be a book pointing fingers at everyone else . The open honestly that is shared in this book shows how much you have grown from a small boy into the man that your Mum wanted you to become.Don't let the past bring you down, use your past to guide you into a Happy, Healthy Life, with those that truly have your best interests at heart."
wanda hall,Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Book,I've never been in to reading memoirs or biographies but I was really curious what Harry had to say. I don't read the tabloids etc. This was really well written and incredibly interesting.  He told his story and it was really moving. He may be famous but he's still a person. I hope he and Meghan are enjoying a beautiful life.
Dragonfly,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,intriguing 🙏🍀🧚‍♀️,"Finally in his own words, deep in his upmost thoughts, a true in-depth read,I have been following like most British people, read the good & bad &  have been open minded to what was Harry’s side, I feel a greater understanding, & feel a deep sympathy, & also really do see the struggle, the book was definitely real, & take my hat off to his honesty throughout,  without pain there isn’t growth & growth is definitely a path worth walking down, which takes courage of course, definitely a book to read, & respects to Harry for opening up to the readers, on your journey,"
Bev,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Such an open, honest, detailed account of life as a Royal","Just finished this book today, and what a gripping, informative read it was. After all the hype, and everything being taken out of context, I just switched off from all the press spin, and was eager to read it all for myself. It didn’t disappoint. So detailed, from the heart, and giving the most descriptive picture yet, of life inside that royal bubble. Amongst so much sadness and heart breaking detail, comes so many funny anecdotes and unexpected snippets. It made me laugh and cry in equal measure. Without any spoiler, what William (Willy) said to Harry, can one day hopefully be believed by Harry, and maybe, just maybe, the follow up book will be another honest account, with all reunited."
Christine ,Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Raw and brave!,Harry was so brave in sharing the uncomfortable truth about being part of not only a royal family but a toxic one. It was beautifully written. I felt like I was sitting with him while he was telling his story. So proud of him for breaking the ‘stay silent’ code that comes with so much psychological trauma.I hope he writes another one. Best of luck and happiness on his new life.
Donna Fricke,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thank you, Haz","As an old lady English professor, I expected less. So I was delighted with the tone, the honesty of voice and above all the superb story telling.You thanked a lot of people and you probably got a lot of guidance, but this book has a marvelous personal unity about it finally which is your magic that trumped all editorial assistance.Congratulations for being the first to escape The Palace.You can be sure your Mother is very proud of you.  You have earned the love and admiration of so many of us. May your beautiful family and you thrive. Each year when the hummingbirds return to my feeder I'll whisper ""Welcome home,"" Harry. What a beautiful person you are. """
Mrs. Julia H. O'Keeffe,Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent reading,I am a monarchist/royalist through and through and I have enjoyed reading this book immensely - the media has a lot to answer to - past and present - I admire Prince Harry in taking a stand and giving us insight from another perspective - I wish him and his family only the best for their future.
Deborah O'Hara,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest,"I throughly enjoyed reading reading Harry’s raw and honest life story, there were some truly heart wrenching moments along with some laughs.

E.Carne,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prince Harry’s story,"This book is interesting, well written and an amazing testament to the dreadful trials that the family went through. It throws light on the Royal family and gives us a chance to picture the family story as we never have before. It is tragic that the couple had to flee Gt Britain. I hope that they will find peace , happiness and security. I also hope and pray that the family can find a way to become a close loving family again across the miles. God bless them all and keep them safe with good friends and support around them."
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in Australia on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make up your own mind,"I actually enjoyed the book and what the reader may have forgotten is Harry’s military training and service to his country, a service he loved, was a dedicated officer who obviously enjoyed the comradeship of fellow soldiers.  For a boy to lose his mother so tragically (and both mother and son were so young) the memories of his mother are clear and concise.  The love for ‘Pa’ and his brother is  evident, despite what we read in other other publications.  Read the book, make up your own mind like I have, and give all the family a well earned break."

Nicky,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Read,"A timely piercing of the veil of mystique that shrouded the royal family and how their dysfunctional family construct & Faustian bargain with the media affected the life a young Prince. A Prince who sought refuge in the military to get away from that hellscape & the peace & contentment he found with his wife and children.The book was well written. Each part explains in frank detail his life experiences & how it affected him (good & bad) and is a masterclass of dealing with the various stages of grief in living color. His shock of learning of his mom’s death, then his refusal to accept that she was gone, his anger, bargaining, depression, and finally accepting that she was gone. Of course dealing with each stage came with consequences that had to be faced and this is where the humanity and vulnerability of Harry was laid bare. His story should be a textbook for ppl dealing with grief & mental health issues on how to cope with what life throws at them and how to avoid the pitfalls that come with it. It should also be a historical text on the role of the media plays in propping up the royal family and the tactics employed by both to ensure its (the royal family’s) survival."
Monina I. Ramos,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heartfelt,Never thought how humbling a life of a prince can be. The book gave such an insight that royal life is more dramatic than a fictional drama series.I wish them a happily ever after.

Virginia Hoffmann,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,beautiful memoir!,"This well, written memoir of a falsely maligned man touched my heart on many levels.

CA Daria ,Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,POIGNANT INSIGHTFUL EXCELLENT READ,"Just finished the book.  It was an excellent book - some parts were challenging to read - especially reading about how upper class Brits see and use and visit Africa  for play and reflection.  But in spite of the challenging parts - I really, really enjoyed the book.  As a citizen of a country that British colonialism used, looted and shaped I was never that keen or interested in the BRF.  But having read this book, I commend Prince Harry, he really confronted his demons and came out thoughtful, insightful and stronger than if he had not so done.  I now have a lot of respect for him and his journey and wish him and his little family of 4 all the best.  I highly recommend this book!"
Caro,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Rare Opportunity,"The truth rings out clear as the chime of Big Ben. Prince Harry’s account is deeply touching, disturbing at times, yet surprisingly funny in parts.. due to the writer’s disarming frankness, perception and vivid description. The unexpected gain from reading about this famous family and one of its most florid characters, is that it’s clearly written by a natural writer (albeit co-authored  by a ghost writer) as Harry’s words illustrate the flair and ease that could only come from the organ grinder."
